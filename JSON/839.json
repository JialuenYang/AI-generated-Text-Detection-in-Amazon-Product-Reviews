The batteries consistently fell short in terms of longevity when used in the cameras. Despite assurances of compatibility, they failed to hold a charge for an extended period, leading to frequent replacements and disruptions in camera functionality.\n\nMoreover, the rechargeable feature proved to be unreliable. After just a couple of uses, the batteries refused to recharge, rendering them essentially useless. This inconsistency in recharging not only proved inconvenient but also cast doubt on the overall reliability of the product.\n\nRegrettably, the EBL Rechargeable Batteries did not live up to their promises, and their performance concerns have led to a two-star rating. I would recommend exploring alternative options for those seeking more reliable and long-lasting battery solutions for their Arlo cameras.",
