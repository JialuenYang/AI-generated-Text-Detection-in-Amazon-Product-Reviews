I did expect it to be a tiny bit more structured but overall I think the extra capacity that the \"floppier\" design allows for is so worth it, and it still looks great, full or not!\n\nPictured you can see my 15\" laptop and laptop brick charger, ergo mouse, a box of flashcards, a folder with a full size Rocketbook and some thick paperwork stacks, lens cloths, peeps lens cleaner, lotion, menstrual products, a tablet, a web cam, headphones case, headset, power bank, various cables and adapters, a bunch of sharpies, some pens, a USB hub, a smaller Rocketbook, my snap on frames, and I STILL have room - believe it or not I also can fit a portable external monitor in here too and a slim water bottle can lay across the top of everything and it still zips closed.\n\nI like the material, keeps my things dry, and is a great color. The straps are big enough to carry over my shoulder without issue even over a bulky wool coat. Loaded up it's heavy for sure but still comfortable with the padding on the straps.\n\nI've been using it daily for about a month now, so I can't say much about the longevity but so far so good, I haven't run across any issues with the zippers or materials or anything ü§û",

			"body": "I‚Äôm aware that this is a bag that is less than $50, but it could at least already come free of wrinkles and in a box. It‚Äôs not structured to stand up on its own. The fact that they fold it to put in the bag doesn‚Äôt help, and is probably what caused all the wrinkles that are already on the outside of the bag. So it‚Äôs already kind of worn by the time you get it. I wanted to wear it anyway, but the outside material already looks wrinkled because of the way they folded it for packaging. Don‚Äôt waste your time if you‚Äôre looking for a bag that can stand on its own and is structured. You‚Äôll just have to pay the extra money.\nMy advice to the sellers, is to actually send it in a box so the bag can maintain its structure until the customers get a chance to use it.\nThe positives about the bag are that it does look like it‚Äôs picture. It can fit a very big laptop. It has very useful compartments. The material seems durable. And it comes with an extra linen bag for storing and instructions on how to maintain it. It‚Äôs very affordable.\nI want to reiterate that the material itself does not come with any tears or problems. Besides, the wrinkle that was probably caused by the packaging for shipping.",

			"title": "I like it, but‚Ä¶",
			"body": "I recently started a new part-time job in a school, and for the first week of school I had been carrying my laptop and other items in a backpack, but the backpack made me feel a bit like one of the students. I wanted something that would make me feel both adult and professional to carry all my items. I loved this bag when viewing it on the Amazon page, and ordered it in brown. When it arrived, I was a bit disappointed in the color, as it it brighter and more ‚Äúorangey‚Äù looking in person than I was expecting. I was hoping it was a richer, more muted brown, but I‚Äôll deal with it. Also, as others have said, it stunk. There is a pretty strong, fishy smell, but it has been a few days since I received it, and the smell is dissipating.\nI put my work stuff in it right away, and I love how there is a place for everything! My laptop fits great, along with a notebook, folder, hardcover book, and some purse items so I don‚Äôt have to carry both. That‚Äôs about all I initially had in there, but noticed that when I put it on my shoulder, the bottom sags. So that is the first real con for me. The first day I used it for work, I did feel more ‚Äúgrownup‚Äù if you will, and it did fit in a locking drawer I was given to keep my stuff in, which I was unsure of. However after work, I left from there and took my son to the orthodontist, then to a doctor appointment, and since I had put my purse items in here and left my purse at home, I noticed quickly how heavy this bag got‚Ä¶ and the lack of bottom structure.\nI see reviews where people say the straps are not long enough to put on their shoulders, but it worked just fine for me. In fact I‚Äôd almost like them a bit shorter, since I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô3‚Äù. It would be nice if they were adjustable somehow, maybe with buckles. This is when I thought ‚ÄúHuh, maybe I WOULD like a shoulder strap on this bag‚Äù which hadn‚Äôt crossed my mind. When I got home I dug out a guitar strap that I had purchased for another purse (both also from Amazon), the hardware matched, so I attached it and we will see how that goes.\nAs for the support on the bottom, I measured inside the piping on the bottom of the bag and cut a piece of thick cardboard to fit‚Ä¶ which is when I noticed that the inside pockets are sewn to the bottom. This is normally a good thing, since I don‚Äôt want to have small things that I have to hunt for all over the bag because they‚Äôve slid under dividers, but in this case, it meant that I couldn‚Äôt just slide in my cardboard and move on. I cut it in half and fit it into one section of the bag, but couldn‚Äôt do much with the laptop compartment or the other side, as it was somehow an odd shape on one side because of how the laptop compartment was sewn to the side of the bag. Not sure what to do about this, or if I‚Äôll do anything at all, but these are the thoughts I‚Äôve had regarding this bag after having and using it for a couple days.",

			"body": "Cons\n*No shoulder strap: this is normally a dealbreaker for me and becasuse of that, it was only by oversight that I looked at this bag at all. Glad I did, though. The handles on this bag are attached by gold metal rings, which is similar to the worn out bag I'm replacing, so I was able to use the old shoulder strap with this bag.\n\n*No bottom padding: the thick padding on the sides of the laptop sleeve is excellent, and I feel very confident that my laptop is protected from bumps and scratches. The velcro strap closure at the top is a bonus to secure the laptop tightly. But there's a noticeable thump when I set the bag down - there seems to be no padding at all on the bottom or the bag, so the laptop is not protected against impact at the bottom. Again, I'm replacing a different bag, so was able to cut some of the padded lining from that bag and tuck it in at the bottom of this bag, so it's not pretty but it works.\n\n*Lining color: the bag is black, the lining is brown. I really wish it could be a light or bright color to make it easier to see things inside. I guess brown is better than black, but it's still a rather dark abyss inside.\n\nPros\n* I LOVE THE POCKETS - especially the crossover pockets on the front. I had assumed they were for style only, but there's a magnetic closure on the big one, and the 'outside v' pocket is only half the size, making it perfect for reading glasses and a phone. The back zip pocket and interior sections keep me organized, and the whole bag zips closed on top even when I have all my stuff in those pockets.\n\n* Key chain - this isn't a feature I care about, but turns out I really like it because it has clips on both ends. One attaches to a metal ring inside the bag, the other for keys. I clipped both ends to the ring, making a loop from the strap, and it's just the right size to corral my water bottle to keep it from tipping inside the bag.\n\n* Attractive and waterproof - I've only had it for a week, so can't speak to durability or quality of waterproofing yet, but that's an added bonus for when I set the bag on floors that get wet during snowy winters. I assume I'll be able to just wipe the bag down if it gets dirty.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the bag, but I did have to tweak it a bit.",

Secondly, the segment between the computer sleeve and the front of the bag is extremely narrow to the point you can barely reach in to retrieve pens from their holders sown into the bag. I don't think this will be as much of an issue if you have a smaller computer as it seems part of the issue is the way the bag is stretched by the device. However, it is worth noting that the computer I use is within the measurements that this bag is advertised to fit. On the plus side of thinks it is pretty cute for a bag of it's size. The straps are also reasonably comfortable and its nice how the bag had multiple sections unlike your standard tote. Will update after a few months about durability.",
