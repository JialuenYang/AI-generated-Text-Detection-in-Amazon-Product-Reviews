The 1080p HD video quality is crystal clear and the color night vision allows me to see everything even in low light conditions. The two-way talk feature is incredibly convenient for communicating with my family or pets when I'm not home.\n\nI also love the manual audio and video privacy cover, giving me full control over when the camera is recording or not. The white color looks sleek and blends in seamlessly with my home decor.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this latest generation indoor camera for anyone looking for high-quality video surveillance with added privacy features. Thank you, Ring, for another amazing product!",
