			"body": "I've been working from home since March because of covid. So my modem/router was getting a workout. I have a couple laptops, phone and TV on at the same time, all day. I was noticing sluggishness in other rooms further away from the device. My new bedroom TV was buffering and sticking. Even with a newer faster laptop I was still getting lag. After conferring with IT, that left my internet or the modem/router device. I finally called my provider and got tons of info - because I'm not tech savvy - and realized it was time to upgrade from my Netgear modem/router. Mind you, it had been very good to me for the years I had it. And I really liked that it was a compact 2-in-1 device that worked well. But it was a docsis 3.0 (that's the operating system) and the new standard is 3.1.\n\nTime to upgrade. I was planning to go back to the cable company's modem + router, when Amazon had a Prime Deal on this eero router. So I got the free modem from the cable company (not thrilled that it's black and a little large, will have to find a way to make it fashion), and jumped at the eero router with the Prime Deal price.\n\nFirst of all, the eero is beautiful. Small, sleek, white. I really insist things in my house are beautiful as well as functional, even on a single girl's budget.\n\nAlso, it's powerful. 2G and 5G channels, able to handle 500+ mbps, more than enough for my 50 mbps plan, and covers up to 1500 sq. ft., much larger than my apartment.\n\nPlus it's got \"mesh\" which means it does a better job of coverage. My cable girl was impressed, which is a good sign.\n\nThe setup is easy. But a little tricky if you, like I, replace both the modem and router at the same time. You will depend entirely on your cell phone data for setup. So BEFORE you disconnect your internet, download the app using wifi so you're not burning through your data. Also have username/password for your internet service handy. Now you're ready to disconnect devices and begin eero install. Once I got the app and my cable login, setup was easy. The app really does walk you through the steps.\n\nNow, everything's fast, even the back bedroom, and I'm experiencing almost zero lag! My speed tested higher than my plan! And I love that I can use the app to see all my devices, their signal strength, and see if anyone is piggybacking my signal (which never happens but now I have proof). The only thing that could be better is if they come up with a modem/router combo device that is just as beautiful. Love it!!",

			"body": "The Eero mesh system was fairly easy to set up. I did run into some network issues for the next day or two where my devices connected through the Eero system could not find the devices on my main network by name (DNS) due to complications of being on a different subnet (192.168.4.### versus 192.168.1.### of the regular network). The answer was to change the Eero's settings from \"AUTOMATIC\" (router mode) to \"BRIDGED\" which means it's no longer acting as a router but only an access point.\n\nThis was purchased because I had just added a computer desk on the opposite end of my home from where the wifi is located, and there is a fireplace and chimney flue duct that was blocking the signal. With the 3 unit set I am able to connect the primary unit to my wired network (in the second room over from the Internet router), and the middle device is about 15-20' away in the next room, and the end-point device about 25' from that, in the far corner of the living room. Great signal now.",

			"title": "Great Router but also buy the Beacon",
			"body": "So I bought this to upgrade from my old Apple Airport Express. My modem supplied by Spectrum only has one ethernet connection as did the Airport Express. Due to COVID-19, I’ll be working out of my house and needed more Ethernet ports and increased bandwidth. Called Spectrum, upgraded my speed and bought the Eero router and one Beacon. I also bought an Ethernet switch to plug into the Eero - just Incase I need more ports.\n\nThe installation of this was easy but definitely took me longer than 30 minutes. I literally had to re-pair all of my devices manually (MacBook Pro, iPhone, 3 echo dots, one echo & firestick) to this router which was time consuming. It did not recognize everything as some reviews.\n\nTo get a clear picture of my setup: The modem is in my office which is in the front of my 1000 square foot condo built in 1982. I’ve always had horrible WIFI connectivity in the back half of my place.\n\nWhen I bought this router, I decided to also buy the Beacon because even with an extender with my old set up, my WIFI connection in the back half of my condo either drops or is very weak. That’s where I have my firestick, one echo dot & the echo is in the middle of my condo.\n\nI got the Eero first and once set up - experienced the same connectivity issues in the back of my condo. The firestick was constantly dropping or giving me a fair or marginal connection. Same with the echo dot in my master bedroom (which is in the back half of my condo near the firestick).\n\nThe Beacon came today and the setup was so ridiculously easy - I was full blown excited. However, although it paired seamlessly to the Eero, it didn’t automatically signal everything in the back half of my condo. The solution? I re-paired the firestick, echo and echo dot in the back half of my condo and now it shows on the app the Eero is signaling the front half of my condo and the Beacon is signaling the back half. For the first time ever - I have 5 bars everywhere.\n\nI gave this an overall 5 star because the Eero WITH the Beacon is a beautiful combination. I gave the WIFI rating a 3 because the Eero is supposed to cover 1500 square feet and that was far from accurate in my 1000 square foot place.\n\nI suggest whoever buys the Eero to spend the extra money and buy the Beacon. The Beacon was the game changer. Little overpriced but worth the 5 bars. Say goodbye to dead zones when the Eero is paired with the Beacon.",

			"body": "I recently purchased a brand new Amazon Echo Dot along with a brand new eero device with high hopes of improving my Wi-Fi coverage at home. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. The Echo Dot not only failed to connect with the eero device as expected, but it also proved to be useless as a Wi-Fi extender.\n\nWhen I first set up the Echo Dot, I followed the instructions carefully, hoping it would seamlessly integrate with my eero network. However, despite multiple attempts, the Echo Dot simply refused to connect to the eero device. I tried various troubleshooting steps, including resetting both devices, checking for firmware updates, and even contacting customer support, but none of these efforts yielded any positive results. It's incredibly frustrating to spend money on devices that claim to work together seamlessly, only to encounter such a fundamental compatibility issue.\n\nMoreover, one of the primary reasons I chose the Echo Dot was its advertised ability to act as a Wi-Fi extender. I have areas in my home where the Wi-Fi signal is weak, and I was counting on the Echo Dot to extend the network coverage. However, to my disappointment, the Echo Dot failed to improve the Wi-Fi signal strength in those areas. It didn't make any noticeable difference in terms of network reach or signal quality, rendering its purported Wi-Fi extender functionality useless.\n\nAs a consumer, I expect products to deliver on their advertised features, and unfortunately, the Amazon Echo Dot has failed on multiple fronts. The inability to connect with the eero device and its ineffectiveness as a Wi-Fi extender have left me thoroughly dissatisfied. I was hopeful that this combination of devices would enhance my home network experience, but instead, I find myself dealing with connectivity issues and subpar performance.\n\nI hope Amazon takes notice of these issues and addresses them promptly. As it stands, I cannot recommend the Amazon Echo Dot as a reliable Wi-Fi extender or a compatible device to use in conjunction with the eero system.",

			"title": "Improved Design at Much Improved Cost",
			"body": "I bought a couple of these as backups to my long-running Eero Pro system, where I had three of the tri-band Eeros in a wired backhaul connection. I wanted to try these new dual-band units out to see how they performed, so I reset my system and am now using a tri-band Eero Pro as my main gateway router and two of these new Eeros as the satellites. It performs so well I am just leaving it as it is, and not going back to my old setup.\n\nHave to say the setup was just as easy as before, and wifi range and signal strength are just as good (this is a wired setup, and tri-band would probably be a better choice is meshing wirelessly).. And they handle my 115-120 clients (I have tons of gadgets, switches, cameras, etc) with zero issue and they've been totally stable. If you have ethernet runs and plan on a wired mesh, these are the way to go for best value.\n\nI am getting 280-450 Mb/sec to the PC's and tablets everywhere in my house, which is comparable to what I got with the much more expensive Eero pro setup with wired backhaul. Lots of routers claim outrageous numbers, but realistically I have not seen any consistently deliver better than roughly 450 Mb/sec wirelessly, despite the theoretical claims. I tried several Linksys tri-band routers, Orbi, Deco m9, Zyxel MultyX, and Synology RT2600ac, and never got better than that from any of them, so beware of theoretical speed claims that just don't realistically bear out. Eero also handles heavy device loads (in my case >100, consistently) with far better stability than anything else I have tried.\n\nI will also say these new Eeros add a few major bonuses over some of the older versions:\n\n1. Smaller footprint - they're taller, but take up less surface space.\n2. MUCH better heat dissipation - one concern I have with the flatter Eeros is they can get HOT to the touch. Eero says it's by design and the heat sink is right under the surface, but these new ones are much cooler to the touch with the additional head space, and give me peace of mind.\n3. These are basically Eero Beacons in terms of specs - same processor, same memory, same flash as the beacon and the Eero Pro, but dual band instead of tri band - and they have ethernet ports so you can a) wire them for backhaul or b) connect client devices to them, which you cannot do with a Beacon.\n4. These cost far less than an Eero Pro, and significantly less than a Beacon, even though the have the same hardware specs as the latter and are more flexible with their two ethernet ports.\n\nEero is not necessarily the fastest mesh system on the market, but iIve tried many of these systems, and I can say without question Eero is far and away the most stable and reliable, in my experience - and that is far more important to the average user than raw speed, if the system isn't dependable. If you have relatively basic mesh needs OR plan on using them in a wired backhaul setup even in a complex network, these are great choices.",

			"body": "For years, I was having intermittent issues with my wi-fi strength using the duel-band (2G/5G) router provided by my internet provider. It wasn't terrible, but there were days when the internet would just go out for half a day and I was never sure if it was entirely on the provider outside my house, or an issue with the equipment inside. I decided to try and improve my wi-fi stability with this router and I regret it just about every day.\n\nSince installing this new router, I think my connection has actually become FAR LESS stable and I haven't been able to figure out why. Some of my devices, like Rokus or phones, haven't seemed to change much, but my new Powerbook hasn't been the same since the change-over.\n\nI use my Powerbook for work and I download/upload a lot of files over my wi-fi on any given day, but how stable my internet connection fluctuates wildly day-to-day and hour-to-hour. Nearly every file I send across the internet has a 50/50 chance of failing due to connectivity issues happening right in the middle of the transfer, and loading large amounts of files almost always results in a failure and \"no internet\" messages during the process. Keep in mind that I'm alone in the house for most work days so I am not competing with other devices using the wi-fi in any meaningful way.\n\nTo combat these issues, I've resorted to sharing files in smaller chunks and giving single, large files the \"royal treatment\" by avoiding any and all activity that could potentially fight the file for bandwidth. None of these \"solutions\" tend to be foolproof, so I spend hours sometimes just trying an upload/download again and again until the stars align just right. Unfortunately, I'm past the return period so I may just become frustrated enough one day to switch back to the \"outdated\" router I was given by my provider.",

			"body": "Pros:\n* Less than $100 US dollars.\n* Software update process is transparent and automatic.\n* Security updates for 5 years after the device is last available for purchase.\n* Pretty sylish without visible antennas.\n* Mesh setup easy to setup.\n* 30 day trial for subscription features.\n* Easy to rename devices, even if not obvious at first glance.\n\nCons:\n* Must use a phone to setup. Sure a phone is convenient for ongoing management but a requirement to get working?\n* Does not support WPA3 out of the box. Sure, they add it as a beta feature but WPA3 was unveiled in 2018 so hello, over 5 years ago.\n* Subscription required for interesting features, some of which are available for free if you are more technically inclined.\n* Cannot use ANY subscription features if you prefer to not let Amazon know every web site you visit. (Yes, the DNS server you use from Amazon provides some security/family features in exchange for you telling them every place you go...what could go wrong from a USA based company hoovering up this data?\n* Cannot use profiles to manage devices on your guest network like you can on your non-guest one.\n* 2.4GHz and 5GHz use a single network name...so if you have a device that does not work well on 5GHz you are pretty stuck. Yes, they offer the option under troubleshooting to turn off the 5GHz for a short amount of time. But once it turns back on I have devices that lose their ever loving mind...why not have one network for each frequency? I can only guess Google envy as those boffins don't break\nout the networks either.\n* Zero insight into what threats have been blocked. Would be helpful to know what was blocked as there can be plenty of issues to sort out!\n* Zero insight into what ads have been blocked. No way to edit an allow list to select what to allow. Worse, ad blocking is on/off for the entire network or by profile. Remember, you cannot add guest devices to a profile so you are forced to put them on your non-guest network which defeats the reason for having a guest network.\n\nSo I am still hunting for the best device...",

The app is very minimal, and that eliminates too many options. What sense does it make to pause 5 GHz and not be able to also pause 2.4 GHz? It makes NO sense!\n\nI generally max out at 4 devices connected to my home network (400 Mbps) at a time. Usually, only three of those devices are active at once. Eero has a clear bias, locking my iPhone in the 5 GHz band and VERY regularly switching my Android down to 2.4 GHz. I use my Android the most and it needs the bandwidth that it constantly gets denied. It NEVER allows my PS4 on the 5 GHz band, but the PS4 can use 5 GHz.\n\nIt regularly bumps my Windows laptop down to 2.4 GHz, and it does the same to my work laptop (a Chromebook) DURING MY SHIFT WHEN I NEED 5 GHZ THE MOST! This causes interruptions during my workday, as told I use that depends on bandwidth stop working, choked out by the 2.4 GHz band. Can I manually change this? NOPE! Amazon thinks it can manage my home network better than I can.\n\nI'm literally the only user! My network isn't remotely crowded. There's no good reason for these constant downshifts. The device isn't damaged, clogged with dust, or placed in a bad spot. I'm tired of having to restart my entire network to get my devices back to 5 GHz. That's what's REQUIRED to fix this. That doesn't make sense! It also gets me in trouble at work! STOP THIS!\n\nIf 5 GHz is available and not crowded, it should push everything to that band. According to my search, this setting was once available and would allow forcing it to do this. Where is it now? POOF! Removed. Why? I can't change it from the device list either. By the way, it's during these times that eero tells me that I'm pulling down 476 Mbps! So, it's not my provider either.\n\nOn top of that, eero have my Window laptop a new IP address. That's fine. But now I can't remove the old item from the device list, so it's permanently stuck in there twice. That caused confusion and frustration too. I had to rename it. And because it's literally the same device, I'm worried that blocking the old entry will also block the new entry.\n\nIs it attractive? Yes. It's it easy to set up? Yes. Are some of those controls convenient? Yes. Is it overly stripped down? Yes. Does this decision inconvenience the customer? Very much so. Have I had this issue with any other wireless gateway? Absolutely not; only this one. I wish I could return it, but I missed the window long ago. It's been doing this since one of the summer updates, and it's probably going to be a permanent problem.\n\nDon't fix what isn't broken because no one is going to want to fix it later. I'm not upgrading to future versions. I'll be changing brands instead. Way to get in your own way - and mine.",

ATT Fiber 1gig, I got the 550Mbps Eero Mesh Routers, and I get 350Mbps-400Mbps down, and 350Mbps-450Mbps up.\n\nThe 550Mbps model was the only one with same day shipping, otherwise I would have gotten 1Gbps or 1.5Gbps to test. But the speeds are fantastic.\nThe power-line adapters I was using (from downstairs to upstairs, so this is no surpise) was 25 down 25 up on the same network. These will 100% replace powerline adapters IF YOU GET 2 ROUTERS.\n\nThis is my setup,\n\nDown stairs-\nCarrier equipment, modem/router to\nSwitch to\nEero Mesh Router 1\n\nUpstairs:\nEero Mesh Router 2 connected via Wifi to Eero Mesh Router 1 to\nTP Link Wifi 6 Router via Ether.\n\nSo 4 routers in total. 350-400Mbps speeds, no interference since everything is on a different channel.\n\n4/5 stars because I can't change the channels on the Eeros myself. I hate automatic as being the only option.\n\nWould recommend though.",

			"body": "I'm happy I ended up getting this over the Google WiFi (the only similar alternative I can think of), even when I'm more of a Google fanboy. I'm a little disappointed in the WiFi signal strength (why I ended up getting a second one), but I do happen to live in a 2500 sqft house (1-floor) with a lot of partitions and corners (and it's not a new house (tough materials)). So, my experience may not be the same as another. But, the WiFi signal is indeed stronger than a three-band router of yore that I used for a very long time before hand. 1,500 sqft range out of the box for one of these isn't really bad for how much it costs (a far more expensive \"traditional\" router looks to be always a minimum of 2,000 sqft these days). The cost of the device is a very amazing deal for what you get. The best benefit you get from these is the amazing ease of setup (it does bluetooth to your phone), control with the phone app (you can see everything that's happening and how it's all connected), and the AI that this device has to do a very fine job of balancing your bandwidth with the type of devices you have across your home (be sure to tell it what kind of device is hooked up as it doesn't readily identify the new connected devices very well (like if it's a TV or game console) (and with working together with an additional unit, which is the main reason to get a mesh system; along with the affordability of it). Bottom line: if you want a Mesh System with an internet service that isn't a Gig, than this is perfect for you (they have a 'Pro' model that is probably for 1gbps internet). Heck, make the hurtle, get in with the Mesh, and you will never go back to the traditional way again! One of these is also really the only way to go for a router in a small to average sized apartment in my opinion. Plus, you need the extra security and control in a router if you're living around people in an apartment building (you can subscribe to a very affordable plan that increases the security on your router (to including giving access to a VPN)).",

			"body": "Quick little backstory, I live in a 2 bedroom house, its not a huge house by any means. Nevertheless my AT&T Modem had only acceptable range and ok speeds at best. The 2 bedrooms were ok but the kitchen and the living room were kind of spotty, the living room was ok most of the time but the kitchen was pretty much a dead zone.\n\nI switched over to Spectrum and the 2 bedrooms (which is where the modem is) had pretty good speeds, it wasn’t perfect but nothing really to complain about except when it came to gaming, I had the occasional “connection error”. The living room had acceptable speeds however the range wasn’t the best. For example just simply moving from one sofa to the other would sometimes cause the connection to be lost. And the kitchen, well it either worked ok 50% of the time. And the other half it just would not stay connected.\n\nIt was very frustrating to say the least, and I was not aware of any solution at the time. I thought I was just unfortunate to live in an area where the internet connection sucks for everybody and that nothing could be done.\n\nSome time ago a video ad for the Google Nest wifi came up while I was watching YouTube and I was immediately intrigued. I did my research and I very much liked the idea however it was a bit too pricey for me, so I thought I’d either shop around for a used one or maybe save up or just forget about it. While I was searching around on Amazon I stumbled across the Eero, I read reviews here and watched reviews on YouTube and I was sold. I had an Amazon gift card which knocked out a few dollars on the $80 Eero which was nice!\n\nThe installation was very easy and even a little bit fun, the instructions are super clear and simple. The app is also very well optimized IMHO.\n\nI immediately tested and compared, and also just carried around my normal routines and I have found that this Eero is worth every penny. I was getting speeds of 21.3 mbps in my living room, now I am getting speeds of 205 mbps! I am happy to say that I no longer have weak or dead spots in my house. Even the kitchen has a strong connection.\n\nAnd keep in mind that I only purchased 1 device, whereas they’re meant to be in packs to further strengthen the connection. I am considering doing this but for the meanwhile I am a very satisfied customer.",

Our Eero is so centrally located we're currently just using one, but if we notice any slowdowns we'll add a Beacon or another Eero upstairs which, judging by the app, will take about 20 seconds to do.\n\nAlso, Eero now offers some phishing, spyware, adblocking etc for just a couple dollars a month as a subscription. Knowing what my teenagers are likely doing on the internet (and they won't take computer security seriously, at all) this is easily worth the money. They also offer content blocking (adult, violence, etc). You can look in the app and instantly see how these things are working -- how much spyware or adult content was blocked for example.\n\nI've used a ton of different routers over the years, including 2 Apple Airport, Ubiquiti, Linksys, Netgear, and plenty of others. Nothing was even in the ballpark as easy to setup or as full of features. And at an amazing price. Unlike some of the Wifi Routers that have a million antenna on them, this is good looking and small. if we need more coverage, we can just add what we need to the house, when we need it.\n\nHighly recommend. 5 Stars.\n(bought my own, not a review unit.

It does flag that address as a new device so you can easily see what’s going on and react but it’s in no way set and forget which is what I was really hoping for! Eero/amazon you can have your star back if you fix this simple feature request.\n\nSeriously impressed with this thing!\nWhen we bought this our service was 175mbps which this provided nicely after a couple of weeks we upgraded to gigabit speed , now this model is only recommended for speeds up to 550 so I started looking at alternatives while waiting for the upgrade to take effect. Ordered a TP-Link ax10 as on paper it should’ve out classed the Eero, it didn’t. The eero will hit 462mbps on 5ghz to my pc and wired to my wife’s it hits 750-790mbps the ax10 WiFi 6 to my pc (ax3000 card) hit 469mbps and only 550 wired to my wife’s! The ax10 went back and I’m sticking with this. The coverage is also impressive easily covering our 1600 ft house, the furthest end of the house only used to get 20/25mbps at best now it’s hitting 120/130 without trouble from this single unit.

Apps for your network hardware is just as important as the hardware itself nowadays. Eero has an app for installing the node, it is quite simple really. But if there are any issues the app is not any help in helping you find the issue. It just tells you to call tech support, instead of walking you through the process of trying to figure it out. What if you do not have time to call tech support? On the app store the Eero app only has a 2.8-star review. If you get this your kind of dependent on the app. The hardware itself is actually pretty good for what you pay for. Capable of decent speeds. Would love to give this a 5-star review, but the app that you are depending on during the installation needs work! Certain contingencies must be fixed, during the setup there are 2 instances that require Internet connection to complete, and your setup of the network is not complete either. What if your cell phone does not have good cellular internet? Your network is still not complete. Looks like you are going to have to call tech support, because the app will not let you skip it until your network is complete. Like I mentioned the hardware is good, hate to base the review off of the app. But the product is DEPENDANT on the app, and it should be fixed.",

I have 50+ smart devices in my home. Everything is smart enabled and this little router is able to manage them all. No issues.\n\nI’m able to view and manage all of my smart devices with the eero app. It’s very convenient. I get alerts if anything new connects or wants access. It seems very secure.\n\nI have the option to create profiles so I can pause groups of devises.

My airport time machine had many ports but it was also over 3x the price of the eero originally. The tplink switch was only $16 so not a bad compromise.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with this little router.",

This Eero is a major upgrade from that.\n\nFirst, the setup is super simple (as long as you have ethernet running and not coax, if you have coax, you've got some googling to do). I plugged Eero in to the Verizon ONT, downloaded the app and it walked me through the setup, taking all of a few minutes in total. Through the app you can see every device connected to Eero, and control their access to the network, and setup parental filters on an individual basis. You can setup a guest network that has limited access too if you don't want to share your actual home network with visitors. There is also some subscription service that offers extra security settings I haven't bothered with too much.\n\nAs for the speed I can say that mine went way up. I have Verizon 100/100 and with my old Actiontec I was barely getting 50/50 on Wifi. I know Wifi will never be as fast as wired, but I felt like this was too slow. Now with my Eero I am actually reaching that 100/100 over Wifi, on the 5 ghz band at least. Obviously one reason for this speed increase is the superior tech vs my old router. But the other reason (and the main reason I bought this product) is the placement. Because this doesn't look like an insectoid alien spaceship, I am able to keep this router out in the open in my living room, where 80% of my wifi device usage takes place. This lets me use the 5 ghz band almost all the time and that gives me access to awesome speed.\n\nFinally a note on coverage, I am in a 1500sf ranch home and have no issues getting coverage everywhere in my house with just 1 Eero placed centrally.",

I have a two bedroom flat and I wasn't getting coverage from my old Netgear if i went to the bathroom. My mobile phone would try to connect to my sister's router who lives downstairs from me. With this new router, it picks up on all the blind spots through out your house. If you have a larger house more then 1500sq feet, extenders should be put in place. As they will only require a power cord. It's easy as they say it is to set up. Download the Eero app on your mobile phone and just go by the easy instructions indicated to you. Less then 10 mins to set up. I am very happy with this product, now that I get full coverage within my flat and in the front part of my Brownstone building. There is however a subscription for added security. You figured it will come automatically. None the less the few dollars a month will not break me (or you) for the added security to keep the system running as guaranteed. You can control your settings right on your mobile phone.",

			"body": "I saw some mixed reviews, but I have had a great experience so far. I had a decent $100 router before, but the power went out and it somehow fried it. I was having some issues with my old router getting my 2 Echos to consistently stay connected as a stereo pair to play the audio from my fire tv stick. This router was easy to set up and it's worked perfectly with perfectly playing my audio through my echos.\n\nI like the app. It is easy to set up amazon devices and to see which new devices have connected through the router. You can limit certain devices access through here, and there are some rudimentary security controls. I will not be paying for the security subscription, however. I do like the app better than having to go through the IP address on my PC or whatever. I have so far had no disconnections, no speed issues, and nothing that I had to reconnect or lose access to. Hopefuklly it stays that way.\n\nI do wish it had multiple ethernet connections on the back, but I do not need them currently. If I needed them in the future, it'd be nice to have more than 1 output total. I am using this with a 200mbps connection with Spectrum. So far, zero issues. I even like the futuristic look of the thing and how small it is. I placed it on the side table, where I used to hide my old router on the bottom shelf.\n\nFor the price, I really like this. I especially like the easy access to amazon devices and how well they pair and work with this, as I have numerous echos and echo shows in my apt. That integration, for me personally, is fantastic.",

My husband and I both had to start working from home using Zoom when the pandemic hit. It's not that we are gamers or have many devices. We needed strong WiFi and better upload speeds. We tried several different configurations that always included a Net Gear modem, a router and a wifi extender. We just kept believing it could be better.

Now we use the Spectrum modem, one Eero as out router and have the other 3 Eero pods positioned around the property - one upstairs, one downstairs in the kitchen, and one in the garage right next to the door.

I had cable experts come out, I tried a series of routers and extenders but nothing worked well. Then I bought my husband a Ring Doorbell for Xmas. I didn't even realize it was going to need a great wifi connection and the front door is a million light years away from the modem and router. So the company suggested we get Eero. We were skeptical but boy were we wrong!\n\nFirst, the company sent us the Eero Pro pack because our wifi is so crappy. The base is connected to our Verizon modem (they give u online instructions on how to set up to most systems) on the 2nd floor, Then we have the beacon plugged into a wall socket in a hallway to be close to the doorbell. Perfect! (It's miraculously also on the 2nd floor.)\n\nThis set up gave us exceptional internet for most of our devices throughout the house, EXCEPT 3rd floor and outside on the patio. So, I bought 2 additional regular Eeros which connect seamlessly and quickly to your existing system. One for the kitchen which is adjacent to the patio and one for the 3rd floor. Now we have super fast wifi throughout the entire house and even in unattached garage/loft area.\n\nPlus, this system works seamlessly with most Amazon products, so with the click of a button on your smartphone in the Eero App, your system will connect to all of your devices such as your dots, speakers, plugs, lights etc. It literally has your whole house on speedy wifi in less than 10 minutes.

Also my cameras and Alexas don’t get connect. I was told with this being a mesh router the router decides what hz to connect to each device. Well my devices don’t like this.

So I hooked up the eero and found a lot of deal-breakers (for me).\n\nPROS:\n• It was easy to set up. Seemed to be very slightly faster than my old Netgear Nighthawk, once it kicks in\nbut seems to have a bit of a lag time.\n\nCONS:\n• Eero is a closed system. Only Eero extenders will work with eero router. Will NOT work with TP-Link extenders or any other brand other than eero. For me, it did NOT cover 1500 sq.ft. I had no internet at the other end of my house (one story) so would have needed to purchase the eero extender (Beacon) for $99.\n• THIS WAS THE FINAL DEAL-BREAKER - It is NOT a VPN compatible router! Description says that it is, but that's a half-truth. It will ONLY work with their (eero aka Amazon) security app which you have to pay for monthly. It ABSOLUTELY will not work with Express VPN. Last thing I want to do is hand off my VPN to Amazon.\n• Auto updates are automatic and you can’t turn them off (even if they are at an inconvenient time!)\n• Seems to disconnect quite often and I have to log in again.\n• Each day, more compatibility issues popped up. Too much of a headache.\n\nThere are substantial amounts of blogs regarding the issues with this system so please do your research. I have heard that people who buy the entire system (router with extenders) seem to like them for a while, but too many deal-breakers for me. Returned the eero and went back to my Netgear Nighthawk and everything works seamlessly. Don't know anything about mesh routers, but I'm happy with my old system.",

It did not include a readme file, a user manual or any instructions on how to access admin menus. A single card said to download the “eero” APP. I attempted to download the APP to my Kindle Fire. EERO was not available from the APP store. I went to the web site, eero.com, to download the APP. After several “successful” attempts, I still did not find the APP on my Kindle. I later did find the APP on my smart phone. AHA! Nowhere, in the ads, sales lit or the box, did it say that I had to have a smart phone to make eero work.\nI plugged in the power cord and attached the eero to my modem. A white light started flashing.\nOK. Next step was to register on-line using the APP. I filled in my name, email address and phone number, then clicked next. Nothing. It told me to click in the box and enter the country code. Which box? I clicked everywhere and got no response. I went through this several times with no luck. So I sent e-mail to tech support detailing my problem. I got back a computer-generated FAQ of irrelevant suggestions. It was obvious that no one had read my e-mail.\nThen it struck me that there was a box with a “1” in it ahead of the phone number, and there was a “v” in it. But that disappeared after I entered my phone number and clicked next. So this time I clicked on the “v” and got a menu of all of the countries in the world. I picked USA, and then clicked next and I was treated to the next step. I chose a name for my router and a password.\nUltimately the white light became steady and I was able to access the internet with my Kindle.\nThis “router” is apparently designed to be used by “know-nothing” users who want “Alexa” to control their households. There is no access to the setup. Having set up at least three routers in the past, I expect to be able to connect my pc and access a sign-on screen with “admin” and “password”. Then I could control channels, time of operation and whom to let in. There is none of that in the eero. Now the APP is inviting me to add “Alexa” devices. But there is no clue as to how to do it!!!",
