			"title": "Hard to Clean Burr Grinder Ruins the Coffee Experience",
			"body": "While searching for a versatile coffee grinder capable of course and fine grounds, I came across this electric burr grinder with adjustable grind settings. And while it did provide a range of grinds for various brew methods, the grinding chamber and burrs were far too difficult to properly clean.\n\nAfter just a few uses, spent coffee grounds became tightly packed into the grinding mechanism and were extremely difficult to brush out. I tried multiple cleaning brushes to reach the corners and crevices inside to get all the leftover coffee particles out. However, it was nearly impossible to see or access these areas.\n\nNo matter what I tried, rancid coffee oil and stale grounds remained stuck in the grinder. And upon my next use, those old coffee residues would mix into my fresh grounds, utterly ruining the flavor. Both my morning espresso and cold brew coffee tasted awful with the lingering bitter and sour notes contaminating every cup.\n\nI cannot recommend this grinder due to the inaccessible design that makes cleaning a nightmare after just a couple of uses. Unless you enjoy the taste of rotten coffee, stay away. The ease of adjusting the grind size simply doesn't make up for the awful cleaning experience and wasted coffee from retained grinds.\n\nConsider investing in a grinder made for easy cleaning access instead. No one wants to start their mornings gagging down a ruined cup of coffee because yesterday's grounds snuck into todayâ€™s brew. This grinder certainly made that a common occurrence for me, unfortunately.",
