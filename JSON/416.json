			"title": "First time spending money on a gaming keyboard.",
			"body": "I always just used my K120 Logitech Keyboard, its 10 bucks, I can use up to like 5 keys at once and never had trouble with how many keys Im allowed, its quiet when typing, the keys are easy to press and find, and it did the job well.\n\nHowever, after 5 years of use, it broke. (Finally, I know right?) and I decided to spend a whole 7 dollars more on a keyboard.\n\nThen I bought this, its terrible, the buttons are clickey, the cord is flimsey, the lights are so shiny it hurts my eyes.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nThe buttons are amazing, what become easy to click, became easier, everything feels so smooth, the keys are fairly quiet but its probably just because I am a light typer. The lights allow me to turn my lights off and not have to guess where my keys are when I type. I found my WPM went up by 10 words per minute, originally it was 60, now its 70. Much easier to type because of the smooth and easy transition for my fingers and how open, easy, and strong the buttons are. Each button feels distinct and easy to find for my muscle memory.\n\nThe buttons are tough as nails, I can easily tell this keyboard will last a while, its easy to clean under them due to how the keyboard was made, literally can just blow the gunk off with a can of ultra duster.\n\nAs for the gaming part, every single key I press reacts, I can press as many damned keys as I want and they all work perfectly. The best part is how the F1 - F4 is set up, each F keys are lined in 4, this means in games that require me to use F1 - F4 are much easier to play because of how the intelligent designers set this up. For instance, in SC2 I need to press the F keys to set up my camera hotkey so its easier to move from location to location, I am CONSTANTLY pressing these keys as Zerg and before I always tended to hit ESC or F5 but because of how these keys are set up, I never make those mistakes again. And due to the distinction of the F keys, I never accidently hit the wrong F key anymore either. Dramatically improving my capability to play.\n\nWhats more, sometimes even with my K120, I have to press more than 5 keys and that 6th key wont go through. This means if I have to run and turn, which is A, D, Shift, and then jump, space, and then press Capslock to talk, and then ult which is `, my ult wont go off because thats 6 keys. In Overwatch this is incredibly common. You need to constantly run, jump, talk, and sometimes ult at the same time. Many times I make this mistake, I will wind up dying or causing someone else to die. However, no longer does this happen with this keyboard!\n\nThe LED keys are great, not too bright. I wish I could have a only blue option but I dont mind.\n\nI only have one negative thing to say: The space sucks balls, its loud, and... well its just loud. I am a very quiet typer because of how my fingers have to move quickly accross the keyboard and every time I have to press space I cringe a little. I found out why its like this, the springs arent tightened, whoever made this keyboard made the springs on it very loose however thats also another great thing about this keyboard: You can fix it because you can see the springs, which means with a knife or tweezers, you can easily push the springs apart a bit to tighten up the spacebar. I just havent gotten around to it.\n\nThis keyboard is a work of art, for the price, I'd say its 100 percent worth it. I'd say this is worth 60 bucks in my opinion but I'll go with 19, I aint complainin.",

It feels sturdy and heavy, doesn't slide around on my desktop. There are dual springs on the space bar and the keyboard includes a red key puller tool. The keystrokes are deep, precise and quiet. My typing/keystroke accuracy is much improved on this keyboard. No drivers were needed, and you can adjust the colors and effects just how you like them using the Function key on the keyboard. There is a Windows key lockout. The keyboard backlight turns off after a few idle minutes, and I am not sure if the time-out can be adjusted. The media keys work. Very solid keyboard for the price.",

The feel of the keyboard is smooth and responsive with functional feedback and resistance in the keys. The only downside is the audible noise you get from keystrokes.\nThe Mouse is pleasantly smooth with good button engagement and response. The DPI switch is a very nice addition and performs flawlessly when needed.\nThe winning tick for this combo is the RGB quality at this price point. The keyboard provides an impressive array of colors that are not overly bright or distracting, but not so muted that they regress out of sight. The Mouse has a nice fading array of simplistic lines that adds to the ambiance of the lighting package.\nOverall, I think it's a great package for light general use. The RGB features really add to the value and provide an impressive overall package for the price.",

			"body": "The keyboard is well built and has a nice weighty feel to it. The keys are very tactile, have a nice amount of travel, and make just enough sound to give positive audio confirmation when not looking directly at the keyboard.\n\nThe mouse on the other hand does have a few minor flaws.\n\nFirst let me start off by saying that the mouse is the perfect size and weight. My last wireless mouse was smaller and got lost in my hand, and my hand is medium length.\n\nThis mouse has a long contoured profile and very responsive left right clicking buttons. The scroll wheel works fine but feels just a tab sluggish when scrolling.\n\nMy first issue is with the forward and back buttons located on the left side of the mouse. They are so delicately activated that with the absolute slightest of touch, I constantly found myself accidentally backing out of webpages, or forum posts completely losing all that I had typed. It become such an issue that I permanently removed the buttons (see photo).\n\nMy second issue is with the sides of the mouse being so slick that the mouse was darn near impossible to hold onto if you picked it off the surface for any reason. I constantly found myself picking up the mouse, only for it to drop 2 inches back to the desktop.\nI actually had to add a small strip of traction tape to either side of the mouse (see photo) to alleviate this nuisance.\n\nOther than those couple of minor issues, this setup is very nicely made and easy to use. The mouse issues could very well be personal to me and your experience may differ.",

Just while writing this review I have gotten used to the longer stroke.\nHeavy back plate. This puppy is not sliding around without me intending to move it.\nI am not sure if a mechanical keyboard but it sure feels like it.\nVery inexpensive for a mechanical keyboard.\nThis will probably be the easiest keyboard to clean since when you used to unplug them and take them into the shower with you a 2 or 3 decades ago. There is no tray the keys are sitting in to hold dust, bits of potato chip, cat hair (my cats like laying on keyboards for some reason), ... I do not see even a reason to remove the keycaps except to put on different ones for different languages.\n\nCon:\nTabs for raising angle of the keyboard, like so many including expensive keyboards are cheap fragile plastic and will probably break within a few months.\nNo macro keys, programmable or otherwise. To be honest this might be unfair. A great many keyboards have abandoned using macro keys but they really help with a lot of programs including productivity software but gaming especially. I think programming them gives people fits. Oh well. Also this is a very inexpensive keyboard with a mechanical keyboard feel.\n\nOther:\nThe lighting schemes are nice but I would personally prefer just a straight white lighting behind the keys. I am retired. I am a vampire as to my sleep wake cycle. I am up usually all night long and up only in the daytime if there is something I have to do. I however do not wish to waste electricity so I tend to keep the lights off. This means I cannot see my keyboard and with my aging eyes, I really want as much contrast to make it easy to read what the keys are at night.\nI am considering purchasing another couple for backups for when this eventually (hopefully far in the future) fails.",

Would be nice if the letters were solid and didn't contain spaces in them like they were printed using an old stencil but, hey, so what if my \"B\" key looks like a palm tree growing out of the ground if viewed sideways? And my \"O\" key an omega symbol without the loops on the ends?\n\nWhere this product really fails is with the backlight timeout. If you don't press a key, it's \"lights out\" after 7 minutes and 11 seconds. No way to adjust that or turn it off. You've got to find...in the dark...because your backlit keyboard isn't lit...and press a key to turn it on again.\n\nOh, and I'll save you the effort of using a search engine for a hack or solution: There isn't one. Any ones that you find apply strictly to the cordless version. If you're using the USB version like I am, none of those work. Which is kind of silly because, seriously, how much power are you going save by turning off the backlight after 7 minutes of keyboard inactivity...pennies?\n\nSo, if you want a continuously lit keyboard, this isn't the one for you. If you want keys without strange gaps in the lettering, this isn't the one for you. Other than that? Go for it.",

			"body": "NPET K10 Backlit Gaming Keyboard, Black, Purchased 10/22, Reviewed 10/22/2022\nI purchased the K10 budget membrane faux mechanical keyboard. I was searching for a backup budget keyboard because my main PC keyboard gave up the ghost after 7 years. I needed a backup so I could continue working from home, while I waited for the new replacement keyboard to arrive next week.\n\n1st impression: when I grabbed the Amazon package at my front door, I thought, \"Wow, this is a heavy keyboard.\" Opening the package, I was impressed with its mechanical keyboard look, and it looked like a quality keyboard but at a budget price of $20. Of course, as soon as I set the K10 on the desk, I started testing the keypress feedback, noise, and how typing felt. Key travel felt a tiny bit stiff but still good for this price point. Any keying noise was surprisingly low.\n\nPlugging in the K10's braided USB cable, the first con is revealed: the cable is too short at 67\" long, another 6 to 12 inches would be better. The board's RGB lights lit up, and my Windows 10 Pro PC had no issues with the new K10. The next thing I noticed, which is not necessarily a negative, is that the keys are smaller than typical full-sized keyboard keys.  [Update \"edit\" 4/12/23: I later compared my full size keyboard and the new replacement keyboard I had ordered, and the keypad surface area is the same. (What was different was the K10's top surface has a slightly deeper concave indentation, so the feel is slightly different.)] I am a touch typist capable of 60+wpm so the size of the keypad felt a little off; however, with use, it would feel fine. With nearly 40 years of using and owning many computers and their keyboards, touch typing resulted in some initial missed direct keypad hits, but adjusting was easy. One additional observation: right after startup, a distinct odor was coming from the board, sort of an electrical and plastic overheating smell (note, I had the RGB lights off). After about 20 minutes, it faded, and I haven't noticed it since.  [edit 4/12/23 I have been using nearly 5 months most days on my Hosting Music pc and no issues at all.]\n\nWhat does a touch typist think of the key typing on the K10?\n• Sore fingers. My fingers were tired after 1 hour, and after 2 hours, they were sore. The problem is how I type, pushing down slightly harder than the average typist, who maybe learned to type on a mushy membrane keyboard. I learned on IBM Selectrics, which required a slightly heavier key press. The keystroke travel is higher or longer on the floating keys of the K10 than on most keyboards at 3.6mm, so I have to push further down for it to bottom out the key travel, and if I am typing hard and fast, my fingers are sore. I tested where the action point in the key travel seemed to be; it's either halfway or slightly higher. So if I type with a lighter keystroke and try to avoid the key bottoming out, there should be less soreness. A lighter touch is possible, and the keys feel good as you type along and shouldn't cause sore fingers. I would like the stroke to be a little softer or less stiff. [edit 4/12/23   After some practice, I haven't had any soreness issues.]\n• \"Noise,\" a comment about YouTube reviewers Any YT review doing their keyboard review on a wooden desk or a hard desk surface with no large mouse pad that cushions and accommodates both the keyboard and mouse is only testing the keyboard's resonance with the hard desk, and that is likely 2x or 3x louder than typing with a keyboard on a desk size keyboard - mouse pad. Typing noise on the K10 sitting on a 32\" x 12\" x 2-3mm thick pad was very low.\n•No movement, the K10 on my full-size keyboard/mouse pad does not slide or move at all. The K10's weight and three rubber grip pads on the front bottom of the chassis, plus the two pull-out feet, securely hold the board with no movement.\n• Key wobble was not noticeable, very slight on the space bar.\n• RGB lights, are not my thing, but if there was an RGB selection that lit only the key letters and numbers, that would be ideal. However, it's not an option.\n\nI have about 27 days to decide if I should keep the K10 or return it to Amazon. I'm pretty sure it's a keeper.\n\n[Update: 4/12/23, I kept the K10 and use it almost daily. For the price and for my type of usage, I would recommend the K10. Would it be a good gaming keyboard? I do play games, I tried it for one game, and it was fine, I have never owned an expensive gaming board or typed on one, so I cannot compare. ]",

Though there is a softer tactile sound which I like.\n\nIn terms of RGB, there's a few presets on the keyboard but there's no software to customize them. You can choose different led presets by pressing the LED button on top of the \"Home\" button (see pics). Also try pressing \"FN\" + \"LED\" buttons and the keyboard will add a cool breathing theme to the lights. You can turn the brightness of the lights up or down by pressing \"FN\"+\"Pg Up\"/\"Pg Dn\". There's only three levels of brightness though. You have the option to turn off the RGB all together if that isn't your thing by pressing the \"LED\" button a few times which is what I usually do. If you really like RGB there's other keyboards out there that are better if you are willing to pay more.\n\nI also really like the fact that the battery is rechargeable via any USBC cable. They provide a USB A to USBC cable in the box which you can use to connect to a charger. The charge from what I can tell lasts a long time. I've never had to charge it after a month.\n\nThey missed a great opportunity here where they could have made the keyboard work both wired and wireless but they only made it work wirelessly. I think this was a missed opportunity because it would have been beneficial to gamers who care about response times and also the reason why I'm taking off a star.\n\nAlso to linux users that are wondering, this did work for me wirelessly on Pop OS without having to do any kind of driver installations so it should work fine for any Ubuntu based distros. I can't confirm for other distros but I would think it should work fine.\n\nAll in all this is a very good keyboard. I would recommend it to professionals trying to get their work done. I wouldn't recommend it to gamers who play competitive games.",

Haven't made any changes to the way I was hitting the keys. I am going to say that after 13 months of using it (on average) 6 days a week, for 9 hours (avg) a day, the keyboard is dying on me.\n\nI get on Amazon to look at purchasing another keyboard, and sure enough, I am a sucker!\n\nI truly love this keyboard (see image of well-loved keys).\n\nI appreciate having the backlight (I get migraines, so sometimes my overhead light is off). I am a big fan of the auditory feedback mechanical keyboards give me, and the \"clacking\" is JUST. RIGHT on this one.\n\nI don't have to worry about battery replacements (thank goodness), just charge it once or twice a week at this point, and I am good to go!\n\nBut how can I make it last longer than a year??

I'm an enterprise software developer - so while i use the keyboard every day, i'm not straight up typing all day long.\n\nThe key caps are cheap and mine have started to deteriorate. This is not an issue of functionality, though - the black paint is wearing off, exposing the translucent material of the caps such that more light is let through, and you can no longer read the letter. The space bar now has a huge blob that lets light through.\n\nRecently i've seen an issue where Windows seems to think the Windows key is constantly pressed, and i have never encountered this using any other keyboard. Even with the ability on this keyboard to lock out the Win key, it continues to happen. I've turned off sticky keys and all of the related nonsense in Windows, but the issue randomly continues to happen. Unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in doesn't correct the problem - only a full reset will fix it. It's certainly possible that this is not the fault of the keyboard, but as i've never once seen this in the past 30 years i've used windows, i thought i should mention it.\n\nMy only other gripe is that i find the colors a bit annoying. I wish there was just a regular white backlight option. For the first few months of use, i just had the lights off. But the key caps are very shiny, and although i'm certainly able to type without looking at the keyboard for 95% of the time, there are still a few symbols and F keys i need to look at. The shininess means that there's enough glare to make the keys unreadable.\n\nSo overall, it's fine. It's better than the $10 keyboards i've used most of my life. It's easy to clean, feels fine to type on all day, and hasn't completely disintegrated over the past year. Given the price, it's hard to argue with it.",

The letters are too faint to see, especially in daylight/office light. They might be visible if you’re working in complete darkness, but I rarely do that.",

Based on backlit keyboard and price I bought this unit, replacing a basic keyboard that came with the PC. The difference is amazing. The tactile feedback, the feel of the contoured keys, makes it a joy to use. I'm making far fewer fat finger errors.\n\nAs someone who eats too often at the keyboard the fact that the keyboard is \"waterproof\" and the way the keys are mounted and removable makes it much easier to keep the keyboard clean and functional.\n\nThe documentation that came in the box is minimal, but a quick search found very helpful online sites including a video on the features of the keyboard.\n\nIt is an amazing keyboard for the price.",
