As someone who smokes weed indoors and has a cat. since using this air purifier, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the air quality and the elimination of odor and cat hair floating around. It’s incredibly effective at keeping both the weed and pet odors at bay, leaving my home smelling clean and fresh. I highly recommend this air purifier to anyone looking to eliminate odors from smoking or pet ownership.",
