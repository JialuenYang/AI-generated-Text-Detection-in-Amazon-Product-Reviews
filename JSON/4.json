The worst part about the original AirPod charging case is its vulnerability to being dropped during flights or while traveling, which can cause the AirPods to spill out and scatter all over, especially in cramped airplane seats. However, this case features a locking mechanism to prevent such spills. The included cleaning kit is a bonus.",

			"body": "This case is perfect. I don’t like spending money on myself and I’ve waited quite some time to buy myself AirPods and I got them as a gift from my husband for being accepted into college so I wanted to make sure I had a good case for them since I use headphones everyday for work and now I’ll also be using them for my online classes. I found this case in my favorite color and thought the case was perfect considering how much AirPods are. I loved that it was a good protection for them, I love the locking mechanism and loved that it has a clip that I can use while traveling or on hikes. I also like that I can still use the MagSafe charging with this. The ONLY thing I don’t like (but doesn’t take away from it) is the clip I just mentioned. I expected it to be metal but it’s not. It’s plastic and honestly I could see it breaking fairly quickly. Thankfully those aren’t expensive but I figured I’d point it out incase anyone else was purchasing and wanted to take them hiking.

			"body": "Right off the bat, the deal-breaker for me was the prohibition of the wireless charging. The case worked fine, and prevented my AirPods from going everywhere when dropped, but unfortunately I’m a very heavy user of the wireless charging, as I have a wireless charger in my car and by my bed. This case unfortunately doesn’t allow wireless charging, which is pretty much the only way I charge my AirPods. I liked the look and the latch worked well, but the latch wasn’t too high in quality. Totally accapteable for the price point. I also wasn’t impressed with the cleaning tool, it didn’t do a great job of getting in the crevices of the base AirPods. With this all said, this would be a 5 star if wireless charging was possible.",

I’ve had some occasions where the AirPods also fall out. Other than that they have done a great job and protecting my AirPods and have a very discrete look to them!",
