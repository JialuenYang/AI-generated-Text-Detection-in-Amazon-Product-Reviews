			"body": "We decided to give this car camera a try to help us keep an eye on our precious baby during car rides without the need to constantly turn around. It has indeed been a valuable addition to our car setup.\n\nThe placement of the camera in front of the passenger dashboard has proven to be quite effective. The screen size is just right, offering a clear view of our baby's car seat. It brings peace of mind, allowing us to monitor our little one's well-being without distractions while driving.\n\nHowever, our main issue with this camera is its lack of night vision functionality, or if it does have it, it's significantly lacking in that department. During nighttime car rides, it becomes nearly impossible to see our baby clearly. This limitation is a significant drawback, especially for parents who spend a lot of time on the road during the night.\n\nOn the upside, the camera's overall quality is impressive. When it works, it works well, providing a clear and sharp image of our baby during daytime journeys. The installation process was seamless and hassle-free, which was a definite plus.\n\nIn summary, the car camera has been a helpful tool in ensuring our baby's safety while on the road during the day. The screen size and camera quality are satisfactory, and the installation is straightforward. However, the absence of effective night vision makes it unsuitable for nighttime use. If your car rides primarily occur during daylight hours, this camera could be a practical choice. However, for those who often travel at night, it may be wise to explore other options with better night vision capabilities.",
