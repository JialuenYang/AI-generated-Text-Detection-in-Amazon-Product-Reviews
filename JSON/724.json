I have been adding it to my morning smoothies and it blends seamlessly, adding a rich green color and a mild, earthy flavor. I have also tried it in salads and it adds a nutritious boost without altering the taste.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that this moringa powder is also great for making tea. Not only does it add a lovely green color, but it also has a slightly sweet taste, making it a perfect addition to my afternoon tea ritual.\n\nThe fact that this product is organic and raw from India is also a huge plus for me.
