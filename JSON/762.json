The set of 2 super soft boho striped pillow covers not only adds an appealing texture to my living room but also offers a cozy and inviting vibe.\n\nMeasuring 18 x 18 inches, they fit my throw pillows perfectly and instantly elevated the look of my couch. The sage green color, though beautiful, does have one downside: it appears a bit faded. However, this muted coloration can work to your advantage if you prefer a more understated, rustic aesthetic.",
