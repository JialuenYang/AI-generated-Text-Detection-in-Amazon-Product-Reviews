			"body": "I upgraded to the iPhone 15 this year (from an XR that still had its original battery - although it did need replacing which was part of why I upgraded now - so you know I protect my investments and do everything I can to extend their lifespan).\n\nAnywho, I wanted to take advantage of the magnetic charging which was a new feature to me. Even though this isn’t technically MagSafe, as far as I can tell, it respects the battery settings on my iPhone and will hold it at 80%, even overnight.\n\nTo my surprise, I have other chargers that do not respect it and will push past it to charge to 100%. I’m not sure how those are able to do it. But I’m watching all my chargers and replacing ones that don’t seem long-term battery protective.\n\nI’m keeping this one and will probably get another in a different color.\n\nOne of the reasons I went with the 15 instead of the 14 (which is otherwise very similar to 15 in specs) was the usb-c charger. I was ready to be done with lightning but still have iPods. Since this will charge my iPods as well, it is the last thing I needed to free me from lightning cables forever.\n\nFREEDOM! Feel the freedom!!!\n\nSo yes, I’m super happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.",

This wireless charger starts working as soon as I connect the magnet. I have also noticed that my battery seems to be lasting longer than before too. I have read other reviews that the wireless charger gets too hot, but so far I have not experienced any heat issues. I do not use my phone while it is charging. My only gripe is I notice that my phone does not charge as fast with the wireless charger compared to a wired one, it took over an hour to fully charge when my phone was at 35%. But still overall I am happy with the purchase. Will be buying a 2nd one to keep as an extra when traveling.",

This charger is quite a bit thicker than my other MagSafe charger, which makes it a bit awkward to hold while charging. The charger stays in place decently well, but does not connect as strongly to my phone as other ones. I don't find it to be that big of an issue, but the charger will definitely come off if your phone falls to the floor, for example.\n\nOverall I am happy with this charger for the price.
