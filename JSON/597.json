			"body": "I bought the Nokia Power Earbuds with high expectations, especially considering their promised battery life of up to 150 hours. Overall, I'm pleased with several aspects, but the battery life was a bit disappointing, reflecting my three-star rating.\n\nFirst of all, the design of the earbuds is modern and stylish, and the charging case is compact and easy to carry. I like the shade of gray on the headphones, and the case provides a sense of durability. The waterproof feature is an added bonus, especially for those who wear the headphones while exercising or in inclement weather conditions.\n\nThe Bluetooth 5.0 connection is solid and they pair easily with compatible devices. Additionally, the sound quality is impressive, with clear highs and improved bass, significantly improving the listening experience.\n\nHowever, the battery life did not fully meet my expectations. While the advertised 150 hours understandably refers to the total time you can get with recharges from the case, the duration per single charge fell short of what I expected. I experienced around 4 to 5 hours of continuous playback, which is pretty standard but below advertising-generated expectations.\n\nThe charging case is convenient and provides several recharges before needing a power source, which is a positive. However, the 150-hour promise might be a bit exaggerated, especially if used in higher volume conditions.",
