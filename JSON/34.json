			"body": "The KitchenTour EK6002 has revolutionized my daily coffee routine with its exceptional precision. Measuring exactly 18.0g of coffee beans each morning is a breeze, thanks to its sensitivity. The built-in timer makes it a perfect companion for espresso lovers, ensuring consistent extraction. The Tare Function simplifies cooking, allowing me to add ingredients or pour coffee into the cup while measuring the weight. While the materials may not be the most premium, the scale's functionality, easy cleaning, and the non-slip cover make it a valuable addition to any kitchen. The user-friendly design, though lacking feedback on touch-activated keys, adds convenience. Overall, it's a must-have for those aiming for precise coffee extraction.",
