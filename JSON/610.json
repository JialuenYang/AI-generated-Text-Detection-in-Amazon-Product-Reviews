			"body": "The LotFancy Spindle Sander Sleeves have found a place in my workshop, but I can't help but feel there's room for improvement. This set of 24 sanding sleeves for oscillating sanders, with grits ranging from 60 to 240, has some ups and downs.\n\nWhile they work for a range of sanding tasks, I've noticed that the assortment of grits may not be as diverse as I'd like. I often find myself needing something in between the available options for a more tailored approach to my projects.\n\nThe build quality is acceptable, but not outstanding. The sleeves do their job, but they tend to slide around on the spindle, which can be a bit annoying during operation. Additionally, the abrasive material seems to wear out a bit faster than I'd prefer, leading to more frequent replacements.\n\nUsing them is relatively straightforward, but it doesn't always yield consistent results. I've encountered some issues with uneven finishes and, at times, a lack of precision, which is a letdown for those looking for a professional touch.\n\nIn summary, the LotFancy Spindle Sander Sleeves are a decent choice for the price, but they leave something to be desired. If you're willing to work around some limitations and minor inconveniences, this set might serve your basic sanding needs. However, for those seeking top-notch performance and a wider variety of grits, you might want to explore other options.",
