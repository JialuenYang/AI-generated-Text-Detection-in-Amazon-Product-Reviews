      "body": "I got it on a special deal of the day only paying about $84 for it so I can't complain about the price. It works fine but at 700W I always have to add time for cooking directions as most frozen dishes, or other items are based on using a 1200W Microwave. I don't have to add a lot of time, but say if it says 4 minutes, I leave it in for five etc. It does require more space than you'd think, so be sure you check the specs for safety, one side they ask for a 4 feet clearance, not sure why, I gave it two and it seems to work without any issues. You'll also have to remember NOT to put things on top of it (you should have about a 10\" clearance above it, and at least 3 to 4\" behind it. That worked okay on my counter. I have a very limited income so when my old Sylvania died (after giving me some 23 or so good years), another 700W, I had to find an inexpensive replacement and this was it.\n\nThere is something that I find annoying. When I want to set it to a certain time, I'm so accustomed to just pressing 150 for 1 minute 50 seconds... but if you try that with this machine, as soon as you hit the one, it will begin a one minute timing no more no less, and you'll have to stop it, and go the longer way. You must push the timer button up top first, when four 0's appear, THEN you can enter you 150, or 430, or whatever not an even minute timing you wish.\n\nIt has a nice glass revolving tray inside. I use covers for all of my dishes because microwaved items give off a lot of water vapor since it is the water molecules it stimulates. This is what eventually killed my old machine. I didn't realize all that moisture was just sitting on top of the inside of my microwave and eventually it rusted. (Yes, of course I regularly cleaned my microwave; but since it rarely got dirty or showed spillage, there might be a week or more before I'd wipe it down. Now I know that by having fairly inexpensive plastic covers (1 large and one small) they will trap most of the steam on them, and a quick wipe across the top of the inside, should keep it from eating away at the metal surface. Anyway, it's a good buy for the price, it works well. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the MUCH higher priced microwaves--but it does do the job.",

I took it off to try cleaning it, didn’t see the button fastening and tore the heck out of it. Gave up and let the microwave sit there.\n\nToday I accidentally heated some food in it: no sparking. So. I ordered a “microwave waveguide” here on Amazon. When it arrives I will install it, and resume using my micro happily again.",

The true outer dimensions are 16\" wide and 9\" tall by ~12\" deep. It's tiny looking and it doesn't fit most things other than bowls and mugs. It does work though and gets water hot quickly. The door is not opened by a button so you have to pull it open by force. The problem is, the feet are plastic and not non-slip, so the entire microwave slides around with the slightest pull. I had to put non-slip matting under it for it to stay relatively in place. Not the most conveniently made microwave nor true to size, but it does work. I will probably return this in a few days if it keeps on sliding around.",

      "body": "Whilst looking for a replacement microwave for the 37 year old GE Spacemaker II (back then they knew how to build things so they'd last), reading the one-star reviews on ALL of them is enough to give you the shivers, one ultimately has to decide on something. Or forego having a microwave altogether. After several days of being without: enduring mediocre coffee, hot if fresh from a brewed pot, but meh otherwise, waiting forever for things to thaw, and so forth, we decided to roll the proverbial dice and get one.\n\nWhich led us to this one. We wanted something with a bit more power than the venerable GE, but as we mainly use the microwave for reheating and defrosting, not cooking, we didn't need one that would zap something with too much energy. Why use a battleaxe when a stiletto will do? Given how many of these things are now all-in-one appliances with air fryers, grills, and who knows what all else anymore, we took to the KISS principle, thinking that this is a microwave oven, that's all it needs to do. Further, after reading about key panels that are so dim you need a flashlight to read them, this unit with a more minimal set of controls was also appealing.\n\nPros:\n\nSmall space - the GE fits in a shelf space cut out to fit around our cabinets, but do you think GE would still have one that could be put into the same space now? \"Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me...\" Not happening. So since we don't want a hole in the cabinet space, the old one makes a great place to store our cat bowls and similar items. There is still function after death. So this Comfee claims some of the counter space, but not too much.\n\nNice interface - I did have to read the manual to find why pressing the kitchen timer button wasn't microwaving, it really is only a timer, the actual selection of time is a two-step process - select power level, then time by turning the dial.\n\nDoor with a handle. I was considering some with a \"push the button\" to open the door, but got to thinking that it is a spring in there to release the door, given the quality these days, they might not use a spring that will take a lot of repeated use.\n\nInstant 30 seconds with tap of start button. Great for quick reheat. Can press multiple times if needed.\n\nTray brings item back to original position. When heating coffee, for example, you don't want to have to reach around the hot mug to get to the handle. This puts the handle back in front of you for much easier removal.\n\nPacked well and arrived safely - good job on the packing and shipping.\n\nThings I wish it would do:\n\nWell, you can't have everything, I realize, but it would be nice if you could set the Eco mode which saves power when not using the microwave by turning off the display to be the default mode, rather than having to re-initiate it each time. Beeps to remind you that \"hey, stupid, you left the food in the microwave again\" would be nice. One second increments between 1-20 seconds would be nice, it jumps in units of five at first, then 10. I can live with it, but you don't have quite the precision of a keypad.\n\nIn conclusion, so far, so good. Now the real test is to see how long it lasts. The 37 year old GE sets a pretty high bar to clear...",

My initial fear was due to the size it would not fit a \"standard\" dinner plate, but it does (barely) ! Food gets warmed up quickly and efficiently.\n\nAll the basic functions are there, it's quick and easy to start things up. Interface is easy to read and use. It's quiet in operation and it also can be muted so if you want a quiet snack and not wake up the baby or whatever, this is a nice feature I have not seen often on a microwave. There is a turntable on it also, so it will do the same things a bigger microwave would. Look-wise it's modern and attractive.\n\nSo if all you are looking for is a small microwave that won't take too much counter space, look no further. This one is a no-brainer.",

Just the fact the once your timer is up it will only beep once to let you know your food is ready unlike my old model it keeps on beeping until you open the door and close it to stop the annoying beeping just that alone it already better and bonus it does what a micro suppose to do which is to heat up your food fast which this space saver micro delivers 💯 of the time.

This is what appliances *should* look like, elevate your space! I had the same hesitations as most looking at this probably do:\n\n(1) I've never heard of this brand before, it's going to melt and light my building on fire\n(2) The interface is going to be counter intuitive and impossible to use\n\nTo address (1) - the internals of most microwaves are almost identical. I've had zero issues so far. It heats up my food great, and I've noticed no time difference, no dead spots, honestly very little difference compared to other microwaves I've owned/used in the past\n\nTo address (2) - yes the interface *is* a little clunky. But honestly a few minutes with the instruction manual and it's not all that bad. The dial is a little tricky when setting cook time - you turn it one direction first, then turn it back to get it down to the right range (you'll see what I mean) - but I'm almost always using the 30 second button anyway. Also it has the mute setting as a dedicated button which is huge!\n\nIn terms of size the 0.9 cubic ft SKU fits perfectly in my small kitchen and has plenty of space inside to fit plates and larger tupperware. 0.7 seemed way too small (also in terms of power) so if you have the space for the 0.9 one I'd recommend it!",

      "body": "We have very limited counter space in our less-than-functional kitchen (not complaining too much though because I have friends who live in NYC with a sink, stove and 10 inches of what they call counter-space so...). We went without a microwave for a year once our built-in caught fire. Our landlord is, well, a landlord, so they were not going to replace it. So we got real good with slow heating things up on the stove and making the whole house at least 10 degrees higher when we heated things up in the oven. It was fine though. I actually was starting to think more highly of myself since our family was able to live without a microwave. We were two steps away from self-sufficiency and I was contemplating taking a canning class.\n\nThen the pandemic hit. Our college-aged kid was back. She couldn’t make her mac & cheese cups or ramen without a microwave. This meant she was asking me for help with how to boil water and banging pots and pans at 2AM since she’s also a vampire. Apparently. We made it two months into lockdown, with temps here getting higher and the world sort of falling apart. I wanted to be able to eat instantly, since some days I’d forget about doing that or even drinking water. So I had to get a microwave.\n\nI didn’t want to spend a lot (who has money these days?!) and wanted something that wouldn’t take up a ton of space but was functional for us. Reviews for any microwave under $100 are a mess to sift through. But I did, and finally just went with this one. I figured any microwave was better than no microwave.\n\nI don’t have any cons on this one yet. It small (but like the TARDIS, there is plenty of space inside). It’s quiet (but also my kitchen is galley-style, so it might seem loud in a wide open space, I have no idea). It fits our plates (basic ikea dinner plates, because even a few years ago who had money?) & whatever foods meant for microwaves that we have encountered thus far. Food heats evenly. Has quick buttons for common foods. I can heat up leftovers, and the kids can cook for themselves which is a whole other bonus months into us all being under one roof ALL THE TIME.\n\nI like this microwave a lot, and it does what I need it to do. I even bought a cute cover for it because we all need some nice things these days and it is ridiculous to have a microwave cover, which alone makes me smile each time I see it.",
