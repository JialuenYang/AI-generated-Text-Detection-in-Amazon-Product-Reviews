      "body": "I recently purchased the Laser Tag Guns Set of 2 for my teen and couldn't be happier with my purchase! This set includes two laser guns and two vests, perfect for thrilling battles with friends or family. The guns have a solid build quality and feel great in hand, providing a realistic gaming experience. The vests are comfortable to wear and the digital LED score display adds a fun element to the game, allowing players to track their scores easily.\n\nOne of the best features of this laser tag set is the range of the guns. They can shoot up to 130 feet, making outdoor play exciting and engaging. The guns also have various shooting modes, including pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, and rocket, adding variety to gameplay and keeping things interesting.\n\nSetting up the game is simple and quick, so you can start playing right away. The guns and vests are also durable and have withstood some rough play without any issues. Overall, I highly recommend the Laser Tag Guns Set of 2 for teens looking for a fun and exciting way to spend time with friends.",
