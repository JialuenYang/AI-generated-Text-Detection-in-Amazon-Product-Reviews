			"body": "I purchased the KATANA H4 Bulbs for their compatibility and aesthetics, and initially, they fit perfectly and looked great. However, their performance fell short as they turned off after about 30 seconds of use. This issue persisted despite several attempts to troubleshoot, leading me to return them.\n\nThe bulbs seemed promising at first, with a straightforward installation process and a pleasing appearance once installed. Yet, the reliability issue was a deal-breaker for me. I've decided to look into another brand in hopes of finding a more dependable lighting solution.\n\nWhile the KATANA H4 Bulbs might have potential for others, my experience suggests checking their performance stability before making a long-term commitment.",
