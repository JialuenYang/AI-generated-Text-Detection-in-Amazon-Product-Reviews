      "body": "I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the AT&T USB C to USB C Fast Charging and Data Transfer Cable. The build quality is excellent, providing durability that instills confidence. The 6-foot length is convenient without compromising on sturdiness.\n\nCharging speeds are commendable, even when connected to a laptop’s USB-C port. It’s a pleasant surprise, considering the typical limitations of USB ports on laptops. The cable consistently delivers reliable power without exceeding expectations, making it a versatile option for various devices.\n\nPersonally, I rely on this cable for extended live streams, using my smartphone as a webcam. Remarkably, over nearly half a month of continuous use, the cable has not only maintained a stable connection but also preserved video quality. This endurance speaks volumes about the cable’s reliability under demanding conditions.",
