That way whenever you get a new lock you dont have to worry about finding a locksmith to come and redo everything, or if youre in need of a new key, you dont have to buy a whole new lock. This one is easy to install, and most importantly, easy to program. I think I had it up and running within minutes. The keys are easy to push and it works every time. We have it set to automatically lock, but I believe this is an optional feature so you can turn it off if you need to.",

I actually have a dog that can open doors and there is no way to lock it so he can’t escape. Some of their older keyless locks do and I have one. But it is no longer available. So I had to put a child proof door latch below the handle so the dog or a child can’t pull it down and open the door. You can push the lever up to open which my dog hasn’t figured out yet. I know they say it’s code to be able to exit a room on fire but children and animals can get out unless there is another child proof latch somewhere on the door. Not a good idea.",

      "body": "This is the commercial classed unit from Kwikset, there is a residential version 917. They are nearly identical except for, I believe, the decorative design and the BHMA certifications. The residential is Grade 2, the commercial is Grade 3. What that actually means, I have no idea. I honestly purchased the 955 instead of 917 because it was, at the time, 30 dollars cheaper.\n\nI installed this on the door between my garage and laundry room replacing a round knob by EZ-Set (a discount sub-brand of Kwikset made in Taiwan that uses Kwikset KW1 keys- this is important,) The mechanism goes in easily. Programming the unit is straightforward and the lever handle makes life easier for aging hands.\n\nThe Kwikset mechanism includes Emergency Egress- meaning you can open the door from the inside if it locked or unlocked. This is true of the 955 commercial model and the 917 residential version. Both versions also require you to keep the key engaged to open the door. You can't 'unlock' the door, then remove your key then open. You unlock, keep the key turned and open at the same time. If you remove your key, the door re-locks.\n\nAwkward things to take note of:\n1. No matter how hard you try, this unit will end up installed slightly tilted if you tighten the bolts properly.\n2. When putting the exterior door handle on (the one with the key hole) you must insert the key and keep the tumblers unlocked to access the set screw. It took me nearly 10 minutes to figure that out.\n3. The Amazon stock is probably not too fresh. The 9 volt battery included in my package was completely dead on arrival. I installed a new Energizer 9 volt and it works fine. Note, the description on the Amazon website says it uses AA batteries, that is incorrect. There is a single 9 volt on the non-keypad side of the lock under a cover that slides up.\n\nNow, the reason making note of the EZ-Set lock being replaced. Kwikset has this neat tech called \"SmartKey\" which will let you rekey your locks without having to pay a locksmith. In the instructions, they have you put the whole thing together then go back and take the exterior handle off to perform the re-key. You don't have to- you can re-key before assembling at the start. But here's the thing, your 'master' key must use Kwikset KW1 type keys. And in my case, our house keys (our entire house uses the same key on all doors) were EZ-Set, a sub-brand of Kwikset and uses... KW1 keys. So I happily re-keyed the new 955 lock to my existing house key.\n\nWe've been using the new handle since the day after Christmas 2023 (it was a gift) and now look around the house thinking about replacing all of the old, round knobs with levers and will probably put another of this model on at least one exterior door.",

We just installed it tonight, and while we were testing to make sure the codes worked, we shut the door and became “stuck” inside. The door handle would NOT turn so we could open the door. We take some hardware off/apart, assume it’s an issue with the latch and some things not lining up. When some minor adjustments didn’t solve the issue, we realize that the paint has been scraped off the front of the brand new door handle. The handle sticks out so far that it was catching/scraping on the storm door handle and prevented us from shutting the door all the way without forcing it shut. We forced it shut to troubleshoot the issue, before realizing the damage it was causing the new handle. Long story short, we have to keep the storm door propped open, hoping the wind doesn’t blow it off, until we can grind off some of the handle so that it doesn’t grind/stick against the storm door handle. I recommend *carefully* measuring the space you have between the storm door handle with the length of the new handle..",

      "body": "This is less of a review and more to help others as I did not see anyone on a review or response to a question answer this with any clarity.\n\nMany are leaving bad reviews on this because it is missing the screw that keeps the interior handle on. I spent a good amount of time looking for this missing screw. Going through the bags and the box just knowing this thing came out but it was not there. I decided after getting heated to go to the product page and search for others having the same issue. I saw one person who stated to read the instructions carefully because the screw is not easy to see.\n\nI looked over the instructions and you will notice on Step 4 part B that it shows you putting in the key and turning it (this is with the handle on) I gave this a shot. I put the key in and turned the key to the right. Nothing really happened but if you leave the key like that and take the Allen wrench and put it in the hole at the bottom where the screw should be and it will go in there a little ways you will notice that it magically catches something. You then turn it and it will tighten against the handle and your problem is solved.\n\nAnother reviewer stated that the hole is partially drilled but that is not the case. That is a little spot where it catches from the inside when you tighten that screw.\n\nThe exterior handle has a screw already in place as well but it is easy to work. Just put the handle on and use the Allen wrench to tighten.\n\nNOTE: The screws on things like this usually are put on after the handle or are already in the handle. These do not work like this. They are on the shaft and you actually turn the screw from the inside with the handle on and as you loosen the screw it presses against the handle which holds it in place. So the hole where the screw goes is really just a hole to put the Allen wrench in and tighten the hidden screw.\n\nI know that my comments may not be the best when it comes to instructions and I am sorry for that, but it will help more than vague replies, reviews and instructions. Also if someone else has posted this I am sorry as I did not see this at the time I left this review.\n\nI thought about giving this a 4 star because of the lack of instructions, however it really is not the case. If others (including myself) read the instructions fully it will tell you. I just assumed I knew and had it figured out. Clearly I did not. So I can see both sides of this when people want to say their point of view. Just keep in mind, that the screw or screws are there. They both are different in ways when it comes to how you tighten them and they are already installed on the shafts that the handles/knobs go on.\n\nThanks\nChris",

After installing it worked great and allowed me to not have to worry about having my keys with me when I get to the building. The lock worked great for the first few months but during one of my visits, the lock made a strange, repetitive beeping noise that made me think the battery was draining. A bit shot on the life span in my opinion but sometimes it happens. My next time to the building, the lock no longer worked, and I replaced the battery with a brand new, unopened 9V. Unfortunately, that apparently was not the problem as the keypad still does not work. I have been on the manufacturer website and have attempted to request support but have not had luck thus far.\n\nFortunately, the key still works so I am not completely locked out, but having a non-functioning keypad defeats the purpose of a keyless lock.\n\nI REALLY want to like this lock as it seems well made, but until I have better luck in getting some technical support, I will continue to be slightly frustrated.\n\nI will close with, 90 days seems to be a very short warranty period on a product of this type.",

This lock is perfect for my needs. Installed it on my interior door to the kitchen from the garage. You can assign multiple user code or program a one time code for single access. Thus, I have upgraded the rating to 4 stars.\n——————————\nI have a 2 story 5 year old, four bedroom house with a total of 37 Kwikset locks, dumb knobs, interior and walk in closet doors and deadbolts. I purchased this electronic Kwikset lock because of the keyless capabilities and most importantly the smart rekey feature. It also goes with the lever type old brushed bronze design of my home’s existing door knobs.\n\nI’ve never been so disappointed with a product that I wish there was an option for a no star rating. This lock set was advertised as “like new” with open box and minor cosmetics imperfections. The product arrived with dings and dents on the lever. Visible signs that this was heavily used and was once in another person’s home. I was disappointed but not a big deal, I end up touching up the scratched and dinged surfaces. The install should have been straight forward but became challenging because the instruction manual that came in the box is only in Spanish!\n\nAllen key to secure the levers were missing, some screws were missing but the most aggravating part there was no key! The lever on the inside of the house is missing the center cap so there is this ugly gaping hole. I can’t even master the key to my preferred key master. How can you do it when there was no supplies keys in the lock? You need the lock’s key to re-key the door knob.\n\nI found this out only after installing the door lock.

There are only two long screws to get your old lock off and you will see how it all works as you take it apart.\nI was impressed by the options this lock had, I opted to have mine re-lock each time, and disabled the inside manual lock. Also, since my other house door lock is Kwikset, I was able to re-key this lock to use that same key! I didn't even know you could get locks that you could re-key yourself. So if you're already are using kwikset locks your other key will likely be compatible.\nIt seems as sturdy as the lock it replaced.\nSomeone has a warning video about at least one version of this lock that it can be easily opened by sliding in a thin blade and pushing back the latch. THEY HAVE NOT FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS. All latch (not deadbolt) locks like this have a little pin on the flatside of the latch, and you mount your strike plate so that when the door is closed, that pin is retracted. When retracted, the latch can't be just pushed in. Go try it on a similar lock.\nBut if you mount your strikeplate with a lot of play and that pin has room to be out, then the latch is able to be pushed in, otherwise you couldn't lock your door and then close it.\nThe photo I'm showing you the pin. Your old lock you are replacing will be the same. So no, you can't just push something thin in the jamb and push the latch back, like in the misleading video. There is a youtube video explaining this too but I can't put a link here or the review gets rejected. Try a youtube search \"door latch dead latching feature\".",

Not a terrible habit for a 6 year old to have living in the city, but it's a real pain when you don't have your keys on you. So I bought a seemingly affordable electronic door knob. It worked okay for a short time, then the mechanism sometimes would do its job so you'd have to enter the code again. This increased as time went on, so...I bought THIS door knob to replace it. The few bucks more I spent, I'd wished I'd done sooner. This door knob feels so much more sturdy, and most of all, always works when codes are entered properly.\n\nThe smart key feature was an added bonus. The keys I had made for the household with the last electronic door knob were easily made to work with this door knob, if I'm remembering correctly, it's an SW1 keyset. I didn't realize this doorknob had this feature, I never cared about this feature, but...I'm glad it had it, and I'm glad it was compatible with my existing keys.

We have had no problems with it. It is open to rain, snow, wind and any adverse weather conditions thrown at us over the years. The only thing that has happened is we have had to replace the batteries a couple of times. These will be on the inside of our building and so I hope they continue to work as well. We have a B&B and so many people come and go and combinations have been changed repeatedly. I’m glad to report there have been no real problems.",

Insert and turn the provided key to the horizontal position then line up the handle setscrew hole with the PRE-INSTALLED setscrew and tighten it\". I saw several reviews complaining about missing set screw and design flaw as the hole is facing up. The reviewers probably didn't read the instructions.\nProgramming is old style and not intuitive. I also have to factory reset before programming my user codes successfully. I do like the auto lock feature. Happy that I can now have keyless entry and auto lock door.",

Easy to enter and remove codes that open the lock.\n\nThe only drawback so far, for my purposes, is that although it allows 30 codes, and allows one-time codes. you can only enter a single one-time code at a time. Adding a second overwrites the first, so you can't set up a bunch of them and hand them out as needed to the cleaning crew or plumber etc. as needed.\n\nYou have to physically go to the lock to enter a new one when the single one-time code get used up. An odd design choice IMHO. I would rather have multiple one-time codes and fewer permanent codes.",

I have other kwikset electronic locks on other doors where I've replaced the deadbolts so I could use a code. This handled unit compliments those locks on my front and back doors which I can set similar or unique codes for each one. All can handle up to 30 unique codes which is way more than plenty for my need. Having the smartkey system was a specific need so that all my locks will also work with the same key. It's been installed about a week and works great. Installation was as simple as it gets, removed the old handle lock and this fit right in place in about 5 minutes. Handle is reversible so can be used for left or right hand door needs. Takes a 9v bolt which is included. This is different from my other units that take 4AA batteries. You will hear the lock disengage when you enter the code and then it will re engage after about 10 seconds so when you close the door it's automatically locked. I used to leave my storeroom/shed door unlocked for convenience which was unsecure. Now I don't have to worry about that as it's always automatically locked when I close it and don't have to carry a key.",

      "body": "We've had a 5 button Kwikset lock on our door for quite a few years. It was easy to punch in the code (can hit all numbers pretty quick with your thumb, hand on handle) but the mechanism was terrible. It sometimes unlocked right away, other times it would take 5 cycles, or not unlock at all. It also always automatically locked every time unless you unscrewed the cover and flipped a dip switch in the back then it would always stay unlocked unless you push the lock button. And the battery tray was terrible, had to take 2 Allen head screws out, and I actually had to take my dead bolt off to slide tray out. Probably got over a year out of the batteries, but still an ordeal.\n\nThis is great in comparison, except the key pad. It's not bad, actually 2x more secure having more buttons, just the 5 button was easier to punch in code. But everything else is better. The lock disengages quickly and reliably, and the thumb turn in back to switch from automatic locking to passage (ideal for us if we're working in the yard or out on the porch). This uses a 9v battery thats easy to get in and out, and no screws in the cover, so easy to change.\n\nThe programming is a bit of a pain, for me anyways. The instructions didn't make it clear that you have to press the program button, the 1, then the kw key, then the code you want, then the kw key. But I figured it out and all good.",

And the batteries exploded damaging the circuit board. Again, my fault. They were twenty years old and we really enjoy the convenience and wanted the same thing. Well, they are not the same, they are BETTER! The \"new\" design uses 9 volt batteries which can be changed without using a hex key to remove the cover. The old ones were 4 AAA's and hidden under a cover accessible only by using the aforementioned hex key. They install easier as well as the new design has one fewer mounting plate. It also programs much easier. And the old ones had dip switches to change to open mode verses autolocking which was under the cover requiring a hex key; the new one has it external and is a great, no, a wonderful upgrade. How much do I like this design? I am changing my other two twenty year old locks next!",
