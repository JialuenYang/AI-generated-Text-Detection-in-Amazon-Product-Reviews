After only a short period of use, the brush came apart, rendering it completely ineffective.\n\nThis level of durability is unacceptable, even for a budget-friendly item. The purpose of a scalp massager brush is to provide comfort and relaxation during shampooing, but the poor construction of this product fails to deliver on that promise.\n\nI cannot recommend the MAXSOFT Hair Scalp Massager Shampoo Brush to anyone seeking a reliable and long-lasting hair care accessory. It's simply not worth the investment if it falls apart after just a few uses.",
