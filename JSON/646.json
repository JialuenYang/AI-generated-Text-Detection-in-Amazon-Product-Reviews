			"title": "Disappointing Adhesion and Durability",
			"body": "I purchased this product for the door seal in hopes of improving insulation in my home and reducing heating costs. However, my experience with this product has been less than satisfactory.\n\nThe installation process was as straightforward as advertised. Cleaning the door and applying the seal seemed simple enough, and initially, I was hopeful that it would effectively seal the gaps around my door frame. Unfortunately, my optimism quickly turned into disappointment as I noticed that the adhesive backing failed to provide adequate adhesion, despite meticulous surface preparation. Even after following the instructions diligently, the seal began to peel off within a short period, rendering its effectiveness questionable. Here is a pros and cons list according to my experiences:\n\nPros:\n- Easy installation with self-adhesive backing.\n- Flexible material suitable for various sealing purposes.\n- Can be customized to fit different door and window sizes.\n\nCons:\n- Poor adhesion despite proper surface preparation.\n- Doubts about long-term durability and effectiveness.\n- Some users experienced issues with adhesive quality and seal longevity.\n\nIn summary, while the door seal offers convenience and versatility, its shortcomings in adhesion and durability raise concerns about its effectiveness as a long-term solution for insulation and weatherproofing needs.",
