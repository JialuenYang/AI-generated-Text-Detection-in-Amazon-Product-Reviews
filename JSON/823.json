When you get them, use them and let them run all the way down and make sure they don't konk out when the icon on your phone shows there is still supposed to be 50% power. That's the only thing, check them out as soon as you get them and exchange them if the icon doesn't show the power nearing 0% on the little battery indicator on your phone. I figured out some people are returning them after significant use and the company possibly resells them not knowing what happened. Most sets are great and they have lasted me at least 2+ years.

I use them every single night to listen to audible books I've already read or listened to while I sleep (tool suggested by my therapist to prevent recurring and almost nightly nightmares... And it has worked for me, in case anyone is wondering lol). Which means that I'd used them much longer and many times over any other pair that I've ever purchased. I've purchased 2 pairs so far, but only because a homeless man at the bus station where I was waiting to pick up a friend was asking everyone if they had a pair of wired ear buds he could possibly have. I'd purchased the first pair a long time ago (years, but I'm not sure how many.) I have several sets of Bluetooth earbuds, so I gave him mine and planned to just get a new pair to help him out. The wires were a little stretched, but they still performed perfectly. In fact, the man that I gave them to came to me after about 30 minutes to ask where I got them because he said that he's never had a pair that had such good audio or mic capability! Pretty awesome! The new pair seems to have even better sound quality than the first, I'm guessing because new and better technology has advanced quite a bit in the years between my purchases (my opinion/assumption... I'm not a scientist or anything so I don't know why for sure, but I AM sure that the new pair of better, though the old pair still would have deserved 5 stars",
