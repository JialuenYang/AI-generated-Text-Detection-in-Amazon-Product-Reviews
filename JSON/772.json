			"body": "I am very happy with this CO2 BB Pistol. It is fairly accurate for a BB gun. You can't expect a round ball to fly straight, but it does pretty good. It looks like a real pistol, it has the weight of a real pistol, it is hard to tell that it is not a real pistol until you get a close look at it. It is fun to shoot and easy to reload. I purchased an extra clip so I can have plenty of shots all ready to go when I am plinking at sticks floating down the river. A CO2 container gives around 70 to 80 shots before you can really tell they are slowing down and its time for a new cartridge. Overall I think that this was a pretty good BB pistol, and a pretty good price too.",

			"body": "The Glock 19 Gen3 .177 Caliber BB Gun Air Pistol is an excellent replica of the real Glock 19 handgun. This air pistol is designed to shoot steel BBs at a velocity of up to 410 feet per second, making it an ideal option for target shooting and plinking.\n\nOne of the best things about this air pistol is its accuracy. The design of the pistol closely resembles the real Glock 19, and it has a fixed front sight and a rear sight that is adjustable for windage and elevation. This makes it easy to aim and shoot accurately, even at longer distances.\n\nThe Glock 19 Gen3 .177 Caliber BB Gun Air Pistol is also well-made. It is constructed of high-quality materials that are durable and built to last, and it has a comfortable grip that is easy to hold and control. The pistol also has a smooth trigger pull that is easy to operate.\n\nAnother great feature of this air pistol is its realism. The Glock 19 Gen3 .177 Caliber BB Gun Air Pistol has a similar weight and feel to the real Glock 19, making it an excellent option for training and practicing gun handling and shooting skills. It also has a realistic blowback action that simulates the recoil of a real firearm.\n\nOverall, the Glock 19 Gen3 .177 Caliber BB Gun Air Pistol is a great option for anyone who wants to practice their shooting skills or enjoy some target shooting or plinking. Its accuracy, quality, and realism make it an excellent value for the price, and its durable design ensures that it will last for years to come.",

			"title": "Fantastic gun. Magazine blows goats.",
			"body": "Bought this little thing for target practice and plinking. Beyond pleasantly surprised for the first 3 days. Shot exceptionally accurate considering it's not only a pistol, but a BB pistol. Pretty comfy in the hand too, especially if you have big meaty claws like I do. However, my joy was short lived when SOMETHING in the magazine that came with it busted. It has 2 major issues. After putting... I'd say just 10 magazines through the gun, the spring used to feed the BBs kept slipping, resulting in all 15 pellets begin violently shot out of the magazine. It was actually pretty funny at first. \"Hey look! The magazine is its own little gun!\" Once the joke wasn't funny anymore, it quickly just became infuriating. Loading the gun was finicky at best, and 9 times out of 10, the spring would slip and shoot the BBs into the grip of the gun. I'd have to dump em all out and start again. The second issue was that the retention peg (idk what else to call it) that kept the BBs inside the magazine when the feeding spring was released quickly wore out and frankly just didn't work at all. The experience quickly degraded into just a frustrated ginger spending more time trying to load the gun than actually firing the thing.\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY - if it weren't for the magazine, this would be fantastic for the price, but I simply don't feel like blowing 12 bucks on another magazine every 3 days.\n\nFOR BEGINNERS - trigger is almost *too* hard to pull after more than 20 minutes of straight shooting. Fairly niche scenario (thus a niche complaint) but something to watch out for. It's also worth mentioning that the safety on the trigger kinda sucks. Certainly gets the job done, but it's not labeled all that well and it feels kinda mushy. A nice \"click\" would not only be satisfying, but reassuring. Nothing much worse than flipping a switch and not being sure it got flipped properly... Especially when it controls whether or not a GUN CAN BE FIRED.",

			"body": "The BB gun has a great feel and weight. It is very close to an actual Glock in those regards. Very accurate. Great for inexpensive target practice at a fraction of the cost of the real thing. I like everything about it except the \"clip\" that holds the BB's. There is a little thumbhold for compressing the spring so you can load the BB's into the clip. There is also a warning in the instructions to NOT let the spring freely decompress. It is virtually impossible to consistently prevent that from happening. First, while there is a locking notch for the spring compressor, it routinely spontaneously (or at the slightest vibration) causing the rapid spring decompression; and second, even with my thumb on the little nub, the little nub has such a low profile that it slips out from under my thumb. This is bad for two reasons: 1. It sends the BB's that were loaded to all come out of the top of the clip, sending the bb's dancing around the room. 2. More importantly, it damages the clip (which is what the warning is about) so much so that even if you very carefully allow the spring to decompress, the top of the clip will no longer retain the bb's and again the bb's dance around the room. You will find those bb's later when you're walking around barefoot. I called Umarex with this general concern. They were very nice and helpful and immediately offered to send me a replacement clip (with the return of the current one). That is nice and appropriate (I haven't sent it yet), but I doubt it's going to fix the problem. I am trying to design some sort of bracket or stop that will prevent that sudden decompression.",

I know Glock has the Mashable trigger safely, but this is a separate device. Anyway, now that I know about it, the first one is probably good to go. So if someone is quick, they might get the one I returned for a good price. The first photo is the manual safety, the second is the typical Glock style trigger safety. You have to push the manual safety from the opposite side, and it will move slightly bad have a red ring barely visible, see third photo.",

Plus the weight from the metal was nice. It came shipped in a package and the glock package itself was slightly damaged and so was the gun as in a few light scraps but nothing major. The bottom where the screw to the air tank went seemed prelubed which didn't bother me saying that I'd prefer it being tested this time lol! It shoots perfectly! And ITS LOUD!! LOVE IT!!

The anodised metal slide, clean flat black finish, recessed barrel and authentic Glock branding are very realistic. Maybe too realistic. Lacking blaze orange muzzle markings of its airsoft cousin, you may want to think twice about gifting one of these to young or novice shooters. That said, the Glock 19 bb pistol is literally a blast to shoot for plinking fun or as a backup for keeping your property free of varmints.

This results in less than accurate shots until you learn to deal with it. However, that being said accuracy is better than expected for a BB gun at ten yards or so.\n\nThe weapon is actually quite powerful with a full CO2 cartridge and delivers acceptable accuracy through most of the cartridge life.\n\nThe sight picture is virtually identical to a real G19.\n\nMy biggest disappointment with the weapon is that the slide is slightly larger than the actual G19's making it impossible to use in the close fitting kydex holsters I use for my real G19. This makes it impossible to use for drills that involve drawing the weapon.\n\nOverall, for the price the weapon is an adequate training tool especially given the high price of ammunition lately.",

I don't know the pistol has a rifle barrel, or a way to top-spin the BB so to rise a bit as it travel toward the target. But whatever it is, this baby is impressively accurate. I can buy several Gen3 - 17 just to keep it in pristine condition as collection. This baby should win many awards.",

The way I took it apart is by the screw at the bottom of the barrel next to the serial number. Unscrew the screw, pull the slide towards the direction you would normal pull a slide, then pull up to remove the slide. May have to wiggle it a little, but it comes off and will very easily go back on the same way you take it off. Amazing feel. Fits the hand like it's ment to be. Easy to use. The list goes on, but overall, an amazing buy. Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great target practice experience. And I have taken it for rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting. It will kill. So do be careful when handling this bb gun. And for anyone who thinks it's a good idea to carry one of these as self defense, I do not suggest it.
