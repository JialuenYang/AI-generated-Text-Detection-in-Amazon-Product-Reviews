			"body": "I started looking elsewhere for certain household products based partly on necessity, but also out of resentment for Stop n Shop's greediness.\n\nI always bought the Stop n Shop brand tissue for like $1.09 a box because the name brand was $2.49 a box. However, they used the pandemic related inflation to exorbitantly jack up prices on a lot of products. Now the Stop n Shop brand is $2.39 a box, so they're pricing it slightly cheaper, but still squeezing us for as much as they can.\n\nI understand small increases related to inflation, but this is one example (of many) where it's ridiculous greed.\n\nMy only issue with Kleenex brand is they have to be fully submersed to be flushed, so throwing a tissue in the toilet with an immediate flush usually means it ain't going down. 🤣",
