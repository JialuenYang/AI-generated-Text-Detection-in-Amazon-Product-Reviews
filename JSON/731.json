It makes it a little awkward.\n\nIf it weren't for the design of the case, this would be my favorite product.

You also cannot beat the price!\n\nFirst and foremost, the convenience of pressed setting powder is a game-changer. It's so user-friendly; all I need is this component, and I'm ready to go. There's no mess, no fuss, and no need to worry about spills or carrying around loose powder. This compact powder has become my best friend on busy mornings when I need to set my makeup quickly or do a touchup throughout the day.\n\nAnother reason I adore this pressed-setting powder is its versatility. It works wonderfully for a natural, everyday look when applied lightly, helping to control shine and minimize pores. But when I need to amp up the glam factor for a special occasion, I can easily build up the coverage without worrying about looking cakey or heavy. It adapts to my makeup needs effortlessly.\n\nI also appreciate that this setting powder doesn't make my skin feel dry or tight. It provides a matte finish without sucking the life out of my complexion. It's a must-have for those with combination or oily skin, as it helps control excess oil without over-drying.\n\nThis powder has become an absolute essential in my makeup routine, and I can't imagine life without it. It simplifies the process of setting my makeup, enhances its longevity, and leaves my skin looking flawless and matte. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend adding it to your beauty routine. It's a small, but mighty, finishing touch that will elevate your makeup game to a whole new level.",
