      "body": "The 100ML 3.4oz Glass Spray Bottles have been a lifesaver for me! I recently discovered that my favorite YSL cologne had a missing atomizer, leaving me unable to use it properly. Luckily, these glass spray bottles came to the rescue.\n\nThe size of these bottles is perfect for holding my cologne, and the spray nozzle distributes the fragrance evenly with each pump. Not only do they look sleek and stylish on my vanity, but they also provide a convenient and effective way to apply my cologne without any mess or waste.\n\nI appreciate the quality of the glass bottles, which feel sturdy and durable in my hands. The transparent design allows me to see how much cologne is left inside, so I know when it's time to refill.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely satisfied with the 100ML 3.4oz Glass Spray Bottles. They've allowed me to continue enjoying my favorite cologne without the need for a functioning atomizer, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Highly recommend!",
