			"body": "I purchased the 13.3 inch monitor.\n\nAfter having tried one other monitor (nice but screen to small) and another one which is junk. I think I have found the perfect one for my needs.\n\nFirst the negatives which are few:\n\nSpeakers are a bit weak and tinny, probably along the lines of your everyday laptop. They are still very usable. Just not for rockin' to the music. Could plug in headphones or speakers easily.\n\nThat's about it for the negatives.\n\nAs for the pro's:\n\nExcellent screen. Very sharp at default setting of 50%.\n\nBeautiful color. HDR is kind of garish, but I am sure would be great with a few color adjustments and if used for gaming.\n\nNice matte screen like my desktop monitors, this means no ugly reflections, especially from lights and my face. :)\n\nLots of connectivity options.\n\nFull-size HDMI port. Mini HDMI ports are fragile (this monitor doesn't have them fortunately). This makes the monitor a tiny bit thicker, but well worth it. You can't even tell the difference.\n\nAll metal chassis, seems very strong.\n\nVery lightweight and portable.\n\nExcellent stand, but with my fold-up portfolio, I will probably never use it.\n\nOne of the ports on the monitor is USB Type-C, which is the up-to-date standard over micro USB, and adds additional functionality.\n\nPerfect for my needs.\n\nWhat I am using it for:\n\nThis monitor is part of my ultra portable Android workstation that I am piecing together. Far better than most Chromebooks. This doesn't work for all phones, so you would have to check it out first online if you want to do what I am doing. I have a Vivo Nex S and it doesn't work, even though the Vivo is their latest flagship from 2018.\n\nI thought I was the only one who thought this up. It turns out that while searching Amazon for components, a lot of other people are doing this, too. Maybe this will inspire other people to do the same.\n\nI bought everything here on Amazon (but this is not a funded review from Amazon!). Entirely my own inspiration! I'm kind of giving Amazon a plug because they were gracious in giving me refunds on two returned monitors. One of them is going back UPS on Monday.\n\nI am using my Huawei Mate 20 X smartphone (not from Amazon, the only thing that isn't) as my computer substitute. It has the new Kirin 980 processor and GPU. A lot faster than my Acer Chromebook which is very nice but is going to be sold. I would suspect a lot faster than all or most Chromebooks. I have 128gb worth of storage on my phone, compared to 16gb or 32gb on most tablets and Chromebooks, perfect for downloading large files from the Internet. I bought a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, also a 13-inch case/stand, just like the tablets but bigger for this monitor.\n\nI won't even compare this to Apple or Samsung tablets costing hundreds of dollars, there is no comparison. Although, I guess the phone did cost quite a lot, but I need one of those anyway. The Mate 20 X has a feature to make the interface on the monitor look and function like a Windows desktop. If it didn't, the Android screen could be turned horizontal with a Google Playstore app. Both ways allow you to use up the whole screen horizontally instead of a small portion vertically down the middle of the monitor.\n\nI don't like paying extra for WiFi, so I have a hotspot plan with T-Mobile with 10gb included. I am using my unlimited LTE phone service with my Android workstation, I'm just sharing the screen from my phone. My hotspot with my regular desktop is extremely slow, large files for my desktop take hours to download over hotspot. Now I can download them in minutes on LTE. I download files for my desktop to my phone's storage and then transfer them to my desktop computer.\n\nWeb surfing is also far faster on LTE as apposed to the hotspot on my desktop computer. Hotspot is supposed to be LTE, but I think T-Mobile slows it down a lot, plus hotspot is wireless, which inherently slows it down.\n\nThis little monitor completes the package, it is excellent!",

			"title": "Very good monitor for mobile",
			"body": "Overall I think this is a very good monitor that will do the job either as a stationary solution or mobile. I mainly use it like any desktop monitor - and it's nice that it has VESA holes to put it on an arm.\n\nTo start, I originally received my first monitor from amazon, but after a month the micro hdmi connector was coming loose inside of the housing and I had to RMA it. The picture would constantly cut in and out. Because of that I am rating it 4/5 since I needed to send it back for a replacement. The RMA procedure was relatively easy and support was very good, which was nice. One other slight drawback I've noticed is that it isn't the absolute brightest. I have a UPERFECT 16'' display next to it and that one is a bit brighter but it isn't all that noticeable, especially if you're gaming.\n\nHowever, besides those couple of things, everything else is great. Picture quality is good for IPS. If you use freesync, the option is there. Since I'm using micro hdmi to hdmi, I'm limited to 120hz but it will go up to 144hz if you use a USBC cable. Picture is vibrant and colors are good. As far as gaming goes, it's fantastic if you need it as a mobile solution or even as a desktop replacement like me.",

			"title": "This is by far the best portable monitor you will ever use.",
			"body": "This is my second portable monitor, and this one is by far the best portable monitor. Although I could use it for gaming, my plan is to use it for work, in both my office work desk but also my home office. It is plugged into my work laptop, with a single usb-c cable to output video (the monitor does provide USB C cables, as well as the charger and the mini HDMI cable, which are all included).\n\nThe high refresh rate and low latency are nothing to sneeze at. Any videos I have put on are bright and colorful, with very low input lag and is super smooth. The resolution (QHD+ (1600p with a ratio of 16:10) is high enough for me to be super productive. The colors are amazing (it is rated for 100% DCI-P3 color accuracy), the brightness is bright enough (I do not use it outdoors, but very good for indoors, unsure about the nits). This totally blows out my previous 1080P monitor, which I have already swapped out with this brand new 18”.\n\nThe formfactor of this monitor is excellent. Yes, it is larger than my old 15.6, but it’s also because it is a larger monitor, but not so large that you can’t carry. The bezel isn’t that big or noticeable, and the stand that it comes in, is reminiscent of an IPAD cover with the triangular cover that you fold. It is sturdy and I have no had issues with the stand, propping up the monitor.\n\nIt has several USB C ports and a mini HDMI. Like I mentioned earlier, it comes with 2 USB C cables and the power brick, which you need to use 1 one the USB C cables to plug into the small power brick. If your laptop has enough USB C, you can simply plug in a single USB C to power and provide data connection back to the laptop (my Lenovo work laptop can).\n\nFor this price of $285, this monitor is a bargain, because its display is just phenomenal. The resolution, brightness, color, frequency. I compared this monitor against 10-15 other competitors, before making my purchase, and this was the one that I knew would be perfect for my needs. So if you are looking for a monitor that checks off all of the checkmarks, look no further. For the price point, you will be hard pressed finding another monitor with all of these specs. Yes, you can surely find other monitors that are cheaper, but you would be surrendering in some specs and this is the best bang for your value.\n\nIn hindsight, I wish I had bought Uperfect’s 18” 2K monitor, as opposed to the other 15.6 1080P 60Hz monitor. I needed the extra real estate and this 18” provides just that.\n\nIf you are looking for a second or third monitor to add for your setup, I would definitely recommend this monitor. There is no comparison to find a better feature-set monitor in this size and price range.",

			"title": "Perfect for Steam Deck and Switch",
			"body": "I’ve had several of these portable monitors, and this one is by far the best for portable gaming. I use it with my Nintendo switch and my Steam Deck, and the high refresh rate and low latency make for a very smooth experience. Like many other portable monitors these days, you can plug in the Switch or Steam Deck with a single usb-c cable to output video (which is included). No dock or drivers needed, just plug and play. In fact, this monitor provides a much better experience than Valve’s official dock and my television, imo. And, if you use the steam deck’s power adapter to power the monitor, it even manages to keep the steam deck (or switch) powered while playing.\n\nIn terms of the display, the resolution, brightness, and color are stunning - again, especially for the price. It blows away the other ones I own, and is so bright I can even use it comfortably in a sunny room near open windows. My other monitors are 60hz, which I thought would be enough for smooth gaming with my handheld systems. However, the difference in smoothness and responsiveness with the 144hz refresh rate on this monitor is night and day, even when I am running a AAA game at only 30-60hz. You would think that a 60hz monitor would run a 60fps game the same as a monitor with a higher refresh rate, but that has not been the case for me. All of the 60hz portable monitors I’ve tried have noticeable motion blur; enough to often make me motion sick. So if you are also looking for a portable monitor for gaming, regardless of which one you go with, my advice is to make sure it has at least 120hz refresh rate, even if you think you don’t need it.\n\nI also should mention that the cover stand this monitor comes with is very functional, which is not always the case with these portable monitors. Sometimes they have weird pouches you have to roll-up to make a stand, or unstable kickstand type flaps, but this monitor has a simple yet sturdy case that folds into a stable triangular stand and maintains a good viewing angle, very reminiscent of something you’d use with an iPad.\n\nAs far as negatives go, there are only 2 small things that are almost not even worth mentioning, but I want to be thorough. First, there is a bit of light bleeding along the bottom of the screen. I figure for how slim, lightweight, and affordable this monitor is, this is to be expected, but i know that is something that might bother some people. It’s really only noticeable on jet-black loading screens, and it doesn’t bother me at all while gaming. The second small issue is that the case texture seems to be backwards. The textured surface faces the monitor, and the smooth side is external (and you can’t reverse it, because of the way the magnets are positioned). Again, a very minor issue, and even with the textured side facing inwards it does a good job protecting the screen; I have no scratches so far.\n\nIn summation, I give this my monitor fullest recommendation, especially if you are looking for a portable monitor for your switch or steam deck. It looks great, it’s silky smooth, it pairs seamlessly, and I really don’t think you’ll find a better monitor for the price. I couldn’t be happier with it.",

			"body": "I had transitioned from a desktop pc to a laptop.\nI bought this monitor to replace the multiple screen setup I had become accustomed to on my desktop.\nI have an 18 inch laptop and this monitor is a very close match in size and quality of picture.\nThe packaging was well fitted good quality molded plastic for a perfect fit placed inside a very sturdy box. The supplied cables present as high quality and are of substantial gauge.\nI have found that the monitor has excellent stability, no flicker or delay even when powered by my laptop alone. The vendor provides a dedicated power plug which when used may slightly enhance the screens clarity.\nSet up was a breeze. I connected the monitor to my laptop with an included C type cable.\nThe monitor is adjustable in picture quality, color and in how you position the screen. You can very easily rotate the monitor so the cables are either on the left or right with a simple push of a button.\nSound emanates from both sides of the screen and is adequate for its design.\nI have occasion to play videos or even Netflix when desired and the 2K resolution is very clear.\nI do not use the monitor for gamming.\nVendor support has been exceptional and any of my questions received prompt and concise responses.\nIn my opinion this is a beautiful light weight easily setup addition for any laptop user. I would highly recommend this portable monitor.",

			"title": "Very Surprised",
			"body": "I like little portable gadgets and this was a great addition to my mobile setup. Having two screens is a game changer regardless of the size. The colors are vibrant and the picture quality fantastic. Very surprising for something so inexpensive from a company I'd never heard from. I do use the USB-C single cable connection for video and power. Pretty slick. UPerfect has been very responsive as well, even sent me a new screen protector because I botched the job on the first application. Don't know about durability yet, but I'm hoping to get many months of use out of this.\n\nUpdate: 3 months later...\nWas working great until recently. No matter what MacBook I plug this in to it renders the external displays undetectable for that laptop until a full shutdown and startup is performed. For example, it works great for a day, next day I plug it in again and my laptop won't detect the display, no matter what external monitor I plug my laptop in to the display won't detect any longer. I have to completely shut down my Mac (Intel Iris) and power it back up to detect the display again. I've tried this on multiple laptops and they all suffer from the same outcome...no detection of external displays without a shut down and restart. I'll try contacting the manufacturer and see where we go from there.\n\nUpdate: 4 months later...\nWOW! UPerfect is very responsive and provided me a replacement display. Everything checks out except for some brightness settings I'm working through. I've tried a lot of displays during this issue and I have to say that this is one of the clearest displays by any of the manufacturers. Very easy to read text and the colors are vibrant. Still trying to get a display that works as advertised. So far two displays that aren't working as advertised.\n\nUpdate: 4.5 months later...\nThird display (second replacement)...I really really want to give this five stars because the screen quality and ease of use is so good. Unfortunately I cannot because they only support the display with THEIR cable, not with any USB-C Thunderbolt 3 compatible cable. I bought an Anker 1ft cable (Anker is known for quality, they even sent me another cable) and it crashes the displaypolicyd daemon on my MAc. No USB-C displays work on my Mac again until a shutdown and startup (see above updates). If a display cannot properly support the protocols and standards, and only supports a unique cable, then it's not considered compatible. What happens when the cable breaks or wears out? I would recommend looking for another display, sadly.\n\nUpdate:\nBeen using this for over a year and it works great. The cable became touchy but I found another cable on Amazon that worked just fine. Strongly recommend.",

			"title": "Great idea, poor execution, poor QC and many issues",
			"body": "I really wanted to like this product, and I LOVE the basic idea. There a number of issues, some with my particular item (quality control) which can be fixed, and others due to the decisions which were made which cannot be fixed.\n\nA key thing to keep in mind while reading this review is the price point on this product — $250 +/- the coupon of the day. I feel like in 2024 this is quite high, considering you can get a BRAND NAME regular 1440p 144Hz+ gaming monitor for around $200.\n\nThe good:\n- Resolution is great!\n- Size is great for resolution, I cannot image using something smaller, especially at this resolution\n- Refresh rate is great!\n- Portability is great, packs up nice and is great to travel with!\n- Included set of cables are great and are all you need to be up and running!\n\nThe Quality Control issues:\n- Dead pixel(s) (see picture) — this is unfortunate, it is in a corner, but knowing it’s there, once discovered, is very annoying. At this price, if it’s not replaced it’s getting returned, as it needs to be perfect.\n\nThe bad, unfixable issues:\n- Inside of cover which has indentations for placing the screen at various angles only has two indentations, unfortunately it doesn’t have one for my most-used near-vertical position. This is not a huge problem as the surface is grippy enough to hold screen in place, but you cannot duplicate the position exactly between uses.\n- Scroll wheel hardware control is very poor, feels cheap and inappropriate for a monitor. Its engagements are very rough and feels cheap/bad, and once again like a part that doesn’t belong on a monitor.\n- Scroll wheel implementation is very poor, for example I do the action to turn screen off, and it seems to turn off only to come back in an on-but-black mode (screen black but backlight on), which forces me to unplug it before I leave when not in use to guarantee it’s not on.\n- OSD, while not inherently bad for an off-brand, is wonky and cannot be accessed in certain “modes” like when there is no signal (sadly, even some brand name monitors have such issues). Having to use the very bad wheel hardware makes the experience something to avoid.\n- Speakers, while there, are rather poor. It’ll get you by and is of course ok for watching educational content, but the minute you play any music on YouTube you’ll realize just how good the speakers in your iPhone are.\n- HDR, like on many monitors including brand names, is mostly a gimmick at this price point, none of these screens are anywhere near bright enough to warrant turning HDR on. Not really dinging it for this, because the big boys started the trend of advertising a useless feature on such dim screens, and this manufacturer is just ticking a box to be competitive.\n\nI always round my ratings DOWN and this would be a 2.5 if it were allowed. With QC issue fixed it would be 3.0. At a lower price point it could be 3.5-4.0, but for ~$250 I don’t feel like the value is there.",

			"title": "Great for work, AWESOME for gaming",
			"body": "I am fairly new to portable monitors, but this is my favorite one so far. I have had old ones in the distant past, but they aren’t even comparable I also bought UPERFECT’s 16” model for work not too long ago. I travel and it matched the size of my work laptop. I bought this one for gaming. This 18” model is absolutely awesome for gaming on the go!\n\nI go to my friends’ houses often to play games, mostly Call of Duty, lol. I used to, believe it or not, carry a 28” monitor and stand in my trunk for this, and it was ridiculously huge, heavy, and terrible. I also carried speakers, HDMI cables, and a PS4/5. I have been using this to substitute this scenario, and it has changed my life, lol. What took up my entire trunk before, now slides into a backpack with room to spare. I just laugh at what I was doing last year. The speakers work fairly well, but don’t expect any loud bass thumping power here, it’s a thin monitor. They do get plenty loud, and they don’t distort with any content I tried. I was able to watch Netflix with plenty of volume, and they even worked decently for non-competitive games.\n\nThat being said, it’s light, slim, and sturdy feeling. It doesn’t flex when you put pressure on it, and the case protects it well. I have stuffed it in a laptop compartment with a laptop and the screen has been fine. I didn’t try the VESA mount on this one, but it’s nice to have. I did try it on the other one with a quick release, and it’s pretty nice to pop a 3rd monitor on your desk setup and then pack it up and go. I also like that it’s uniform size, one rectangle without any concave parts to possibly allow it to be damaged when it’s packed under pressure.\n\nEven at its larger size, the resolution is sharp at 1600p. I’m not a fan of “anti-glare” coatings, but this one is so subtle, and the monitor has high enough resolution, that it works well. The thing I love is 144hz. I have a G14 and it runs COD on this at nearly double that refresh rate. It works out perfectly because it is buttery smooth. I’m not sure of the response time on this, but it must be insanely low, I’m thinking between 1-5ms. I have zero lag or interference in high-speed games.\n\nThe brightness is plenty, even in direct light. In fact, I don’t even turn it up all the way, most of the time. The knob on my 16” had instant access to brightness, so you tap it up and it was volume, you tap it down and it was brightness, that was fast. This one is volume only. You have to access a menu, go inside the menu by pushing in the knob, and then set the brightness. I wish it was less steps, but there are two significant factors to change this. One, this monitor remains at full brightness if you use external power. It doesn’t revert to 1 if you plug it in each time. Two, use an app called “Monitorian” from the Windows Store, you will thank me later. Just pin that to your taskbar, and with this type C connection, you have an instant slider to drag the brightness of your external monitor! I don’t even touch the buttons on the monitor anymore.\n\nI will likely pickup a 4k monitor from this brand in the future, especially if they offer a 120hz+ 4k monitor that’s large enough for my professional editing. However, this monitor can easily be used for this purpose, and I’ve already tested it out. The 100% DCI-P3 color space and 100% sRGB is accurate and improves the HDR functionality. I tried both color spaces in a few edits, and both represented well, with DCI-P3 being slightly better, probably due to its larger color coverage. Either way, this is a universal monitor.\nIt comes with two type C cables, one for charging and one for video transfer, but I believe they’re both universal and quite high-end cables. It has a nice power block that folds the plug in for travel. It has a mini-HDMI cable as well for PS5, Switch, etc. I will try to throw up some photos as well. I did a quick unboxing because I was so excited over this thing, lol.\n\nEverything is a “pro” for me on this. The only “con” would be if you need to squeeze a portable monitor into a small bag for travel. That’s also why I have the 16” version for the office bag. This still fit into my larger backpack though. I thought this thing was massive at first, now I think everything else is just small, lol. I may even pick up a larger one if they ever offer one, but this one is amazing.",

			"body": "First of all, I appreciate the customer service. They really want to learn feedback from the customer and actively provide help. I first bought their 16'' 120hz monitor and they sent me the wrong one. Once I notice them, they send the correct one very quickly. After a half month of usage for the 16'' monitor, I decide to change to this one. Here are some reasons for this movement.\n\nThis monitor is good for gaming. 144hz makes the game display more smooth and more vivid. I ran some 3A games on this monitor and it presents very well. I also use this monitor to play some mobile games. It displays very well. I do not need to stare at my small phone game. Since it requires a single power supply, which means you need to charge while using it, I do not worry about my phone's power anymore. Besides, this connection with my monitor can charge my phone as well.\n\nSecondly, the screen. 18'' monitor can show more details than the 16'' one. A large screen can help more than the gameplay. It is also helpful for work. I can read detailed information easily. Besides, the brightness and color on this monitor display very well. It is very comfortable when watching some HDR videos through this monitor. The photo and video editions on this monitor also present well. \n\nAdditionally, compared with the 16'' one, this monitor has more adjustment choices for display, which is a good thing for me. I have more ways to design for my use.\n\nFurthermore, the monitor is easy to carry. I sometimes need to move to different places, and this monitor is not heavy. My backpack is enough for it.\n\nOne shortcoming of my experience is that the connection is not as stable as I thought. Sometimes, the screen would pause in the dark for one second, and then recover to normal. I am not sure about the reason yet, but I bought two Type C cables to replace the original cables, and this situation is gone. Until this time, this monitor displays very well.",

			"body": "Play Video\nFirst and foremost, WOW, I'm blown away by how great this monitor is. Stick with me, this review can be a bit long if you are not patient but I wrote this review to help you reassure you. I ordered the 16.1 inch display and I got the 16.1 inch display. Why did I say this? The small product picture was showing 13.1 so I got worried but no, it's actually a 16.1 inch display as told in the product name, images and description. I've seen people talking a lot about the monitor audio quality but for me, it's not as bad as people were saying. Yes it maybe lacking a bit, especially the bass but it didn't break my immersion while playing games. It's pretty loud actually so I have to keep the volume at 5. The brightness? God, don't even get me started. The 500 nits as advertised is not laughing matter. It's serious business right there. I could use my laptop with that monitor in DIRECT sunlight and I can see everything clearly and most important of all, vibrantly. The color accuracy is spectacular because it is a 100% srgb ips display. I prefer this monitor's natural color and tone because there are monitors out there with glossy screen, QLED or OLED and they are amazing, don't get me wrong. I stand by this IPS monitor especially because it is very easy on my eyes thanks to it's anti-glare, flicker free and MATTE display. No matter how others say glossy screen is more vibrant and sharp, I would NEVER trade it with matte display with is cool and non-reflective because I mostly use my laptop in a well-lit room unlike others who are using laptops in a dark room. Games aren't the only thing I do. I study a lot with my laptop. I'm a senior year student and there are way to many things to read and homework to do. This matte display soothes my eyes and they never get tired no matter how long I read with my new fancy monitor. I've included some pictures together with my review if you are curious. I watch videos on the left while I look at my school works, documents, ebooks on the right with my portable monitor. Together with the 144Hz refresh rate, GOD I've never felt so satisfied while studying as I scroll down the page. Oh I'm an international student so portable monitor is better. Because at the end of the semester or year, when I move out, I can just pack my monitor into my bag and just leave. I don't need to leave it like giving away or selling my 27 inch or whatever monitor to someone else as I leave. That saves big bucks! I'm a big nintendo guy and I solely game on my switch. My favorite game is Xenoblade and I've included some gameplay video of it in this review. Do note that the display's color is a lot better in person. If you see color being too sharp or bright, it's my phone's camera doing unnecessary processing. In person this monitor is beautiful. Xenoblade is a game where colors bring life to the game and the monitor makes sure I can feel it. The 10 sec clip is a great example of xenoblade moment where I get randomly one shotted by a mob out in the field. LOL that was totally unplanned. All games I played on this monitor, colors are perfect. If you want a monitor which is even more vibrant as if the colors are popping out, there are QLED or OLED monitors out there but I'm not a fan of those. I love my games to be color accurate and vibrant but not too sharp or popping out so that my eyes can rest easy. This is why I'm sticking to this 16.1 inch IPS monitor. Kudos to Uperfect for making a budget friendly yet great quality monitor.\n10/10\nI will recommend this monitor to anyone interested in portable monitor. More like any monitor from this brand in general.",

			"title": "Very Impressed with 2k 144hz 18\" QHD monitor (Detailed Review)",
			"body": "Things covered:\n-Pricing\n-Display quality\n-Build quality\n-Use cases/Portability\n-Impact on battery life\n-Customer support\n\n-Pricing: This monitor was purchased at a price of $285, at the time it was the only 18\" monitor which was QHD+ (1600p), all the other ones online were FHD (1080p). The are cheaper 17.3in products but they are not 16:10 (wanted it for productivity and to match the aspect ratio of most modern laptops), and did not have any display color accuracy rating. That is why I decided that this monitor would be the best for screen real estate as well as color accuracy. I did not purchase this monitor for high refresh rate gaming, but it has a 144hz refresh rate and I have not noticed any input lag or ghosting which would hinder gaming. I believe for the feature set that this monitor offers it is the best value for money. There are monitors around 100 dollars cheaper with similar resolution and refresh rate, but they do not offer the 18\" screen size or color accuracy ratings.\n\n-Display quality: This monitor is rated for 100% DCI-P3 color accuracy, and if you are not familiar with those, this is about as good as it gets for even most professional use cases. This laptop beats the screen on my 16' LG Gram 2021 2 in 1 which is advertised for creators and also has a high level of color accuracy. I do not do creative work, but have attached images which highlight the color accuracy of both displays.\n\n-Build quality: The construction is 100% metal and glass. The case is a nice rubber material which feels sturdy and not slippery. I feel comfortable using this monitor in my lap and on glass tables. The cover is also decently thick so I haven't had problems stacking other thing on top of this monitor. I often stack my laptop and monitor and the two end up being less than 1inch thick together, very portable. Additionally, the bezels are very thin and this 18\" monitor is the same size as my 16\" laptop while having a much larger screen thanks to the thinner bezels and size. Definitely do not shy away from this due to size relative to your own machine if you are comfortable with a 15in or larger laptop and are looking for more screen space.\n\n-Use cases/Portability: This monitor feels very light yet sturdy, so I am fine using it in my lap and in tighter places. You can choose to power it by your laptop or with supplementary external power. What I do sometimes is supply power from a powerbank. This helps considerably with battery life on the laptop but it is less convenient and kind of bulky. You can use it in a vertical or horizontal configuration, just make sure you change your display settings. I have not felt hindered by using this monitors except for very rare cases where there is no lap or desk space available. This monitor has speakers, but you are nearly always better off using your laptop speakers.\n\n-Impact on battery life: I can use it away from a power source at maximum brightness/refresh rate for around 3 hours and on 3/10 brightness and 60hz refresh rate (I recommend turning off 144hz if using this on battery unless you're gaming), I get around 5 hours of nonstop use. For reference typically on my laptop alone at a 3/10 brightness I get 10 hours of nonstop use.\n\n-Customer support: I had a issue (just nitpicking since I prefer things be completely perfect) with the smart cover which came with the monitor and the customer support were kind enough to resolve my issue in a couple days. Aside from a tiny scuff on the case which was resolved within days, the monitor came in excellent condition/packaging, and no matter how hard I try I do not notice any dead pixels.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a second or third monitor to add for on the go use, I would definitely recommend this monitor, provided that your laptop has the battery overhead to handle it, or that you will be near a power source. I am unable to find a better feature-set monitor at this size and price range.",

			"body": "I owns like 5 portable monitors from different brands and UPERFECT is probably my most favortite one. Biggest reason: AFFORDABLE.\nIn the picture is the 18” and the 15,6” I bought from them and they are both amazing.\nPros: The screen is very well made and sturdy. All the ports and buttons work perfectly fine. Refresh rate is on point and color vibrance is decent. And the speaker is decent also. For the price of under $300, this is hand down the best one in the market.\nCons: The mini HDMI port is not deep enough so the jack doesnt go all the way in at all. But that doesnt cause any problem tho, everything still work fine. Also, if you like your screen to be super bright, this screen might not be for u, it only has 350 nits compared to the 15.6” version. Also, color vibrance is kinda yellowy on this monitor, but can be fixed in its setting so no big deal.\n\nIn conclusion, if you look for a great monitor for under 300$, none can beat this. Even the one that is ranged from 300 to 400$ cant even come close to this anyway.",

			"title": "The best portable monitor for Xbox Series X",
			"body": "After having issues with Xbox support on THREE other monitors, I’m glad I stuck with this one.\nIt’s by far my favourite. Here’s why:\n\nXbox support\nBy far my favourite thing about this monitor is it’s Xbox support. Unlike the previous two monitors I tried, it actually supports 1440p at 120hz with Freesync! (A feature that allows your refresh rate to dynamically adapt to your frame rate.)\nThe others only support 1080p at 120hz (without Freesync),\nor 1440p at 60hz (without Freesync),\nor 1080p at 60hz (with FreeSync).\nWith this monitor I finally get all three! Upgraded Resolution, Refresh Rate, and FreeSync!\n\nBrightness\nI was quite surprised at the brightness. The monitors I tried before maxed out at 400 nits, while this one reaches 500. It doesn’t seem like that big a difference, but in practice, it means that I can use this monitor in a bright room without squinting.\n\nColor\nThe increased brightness allows for better color. When using this monitor with my USB-C dock, the difference is clear. When moving images between monitors, the saturation and vibrancy of the image is clearly superior to my laptop’s screen and my other monitors.\n\nScreen size\nThe jump from 16” to 18” makes a massive difference. It fits snugly in my bag, and the larger screen size means I can fit more on the screen without having to squint.\n\nResponsiveness\nThe response time is also noticeably faster, as someone who grew up playing games on TVs. It makes a huge difference in playability in quick-response games (like Ghostrunner and Doom Eternal).\n\nLaptop support\nThe 16:10 aspect ratio is perfect for PC use. As a programmer and a student, I find the taller aspect ratio perfect for reading (textbooks, articles, and websites), and multitasking when coding (like Visual Studio and a terminal). The 2560x1660 resolution makes everything crystal clear, and noticeably smooth at it’s 144hz refresh rate.\n\nPhone Support\nMy Samsung phone is a pretty old, so it only output at 1080p, but sure enough, it works seamlessly over USB-C. The desktop mode (DeX) mode is super neat. This isn’t my usual usecase, but it worked great in my experiment.\n\nHardware\nIt’s actually incredibly sturdy - the first thing you notice about it is just how durable it feels. It comes with all the cords you’ll need to run it, and an AC adapter to power it. All of which works super well. Additionally, it supports pass-through charging, so if you have a higher-watt AC adapter, you can charge your laptop through the monitor (which requires less cables, and is necessary if your laptop only has 1 charging port like mine). One thing this monitor offers that I hadn’t seen before was a built-in audio jack, which was a nice addition.\n\nInterface\nThe interface is also a huge step-up from cheaper monitors. The menu pops up in the bottom right, instead of right in the middle of the screen, which is already so much nicer. Then, the automatic aspect ratio adjustment is leagues better than my previous monitor. Now I don’t have to change the settings every time I switch between my Xbox and my laptop.\n\nIn my experience, the Uperfect Monitor has exceeded expectations. It stands out in terms of Xbox support, brightness, color quality, and screen size. It's a worthy offering for anyone seeking a versatile and high-performing display. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with this monitor and would rate it a solid 5/5.",

			"body": "I've have had this monitor for a month now and it was definetly a learning curve on getting the best use out of it for my needs. So the monitor is well built and the screen looks great and the HDR is alright it isn't terrible but not the best either. The main issue with this monitor is its lack of support for Desktop gaming. With modern Nvidia cards your only option is HDMI. You can not use Display port with this monitor do not try using a Bi-directional Display Port to USB-C cable DO NOT ATTEMPT!!! The cable will if your lucky just burn out and not work anymore if your unlucky, like me it will heat up and catch on fire. I don't know if its because the monitor doesn't support DP alt mode and its trying to charge instead of transmit data or what. I lost one Cable it just stopped working so I bought a different brand thinking it was just an inferior cable and the second one legitimately caught on fire. Using a RTX 4080 and thankfully I caught this situation before it got out of hand. So if your reading this I'm going to save you a great amount of trouble. If your using a Desktop computer with a 4000 series GPU go HDMI and make sure its HDMI 2.0. This is the only option for getting the full potential out of this monitor 1440p 144hz with freesync. If your using it for anyother purpose, laptops, Gaming Consoles, Phone/tablet, steam deck....It's more suited to those and you'll probably get a great experience. If your using a Desktop GPU without a USB-C out though follow my advice or just move up to an actual monitor with a Display Port input.\n\n11/29/23 The company reached out to me about my review and recommended a USB-C to Display Port cable other customers have used amd even offered to reimburse me for it, I gave one more star for exceptional customer service. I still would buy this monitor again as in its class its definitely the best available. I just hope they will either make a USB-C to DP cable to include with future products or include a Mini HDMI cable capable of HDMI 2.0 to give Desktop PC gamers the full experience.\n\n11/30/23 I'm not going to change the stars but this is the final update. This monitor does not support 144 hz at all for a Desktop PC unless the GPU has a USB-C out. I regret buying it now, even though it supports HDMI 2.0 the monitor is still locked to 120 hz and only 8 bit HDR, extremely disappointing. There are no USB-C monitors that are capable of 4000 Series GPU support so if you expect to use this with those cards don't. Buy a DP monitor only way to get the max performance.",

I've never had a 16:10 resolution before, but now I'm wondering how I lived without it. The extra vertical space is really noticeable and I enjoy it a lot. When gaming or consuming 16:9 content, it automatically adjusts and I've had no problem with it. You pretty much can't notice the small black bars at the top/bottom because they're small and just seem like an extension of the bezels. The brightness/display is good, and the features are nice as well.\n\nUperfect Support has also been amazing. The first monitor I received had been slightly damaged, likely a shipping defect, and they worked with me to resolve it very quickly. The support staff are almost as good as the monitor itself. Lol",

However, to my surprise, they went above and beyond to resolve the problem. Initially, they offered a discount since the monitor required both USB-C display input and a wall plug instead of dual USB C, which was advertised. Later, when the flickering persisted, they patiently guided me through troubleshooting steps. Ultimately, they replaced the monitor and refunded the remaining purchase amount.\n\nThis exceptional customer service has restored my faith in companies that genuinely care about their customers. The company's prompt response, willingness to find a solution, and commitment to customer satisfaction are commendable. I highly recommend this company and its products, knowing that they stand behind their products and prioritize customer satisfaction.\n\nI knocked off a star in the picture quality category simply because its almost impossible to dial in color accuracy on this monitor.",

			"title": "Great smaller 2k monitor for multi-monitor setups or travel.",
			"body": "I got 4 of these monitors for a SFFPC build that I can travel with in a single case. I have been using them for about a month and they have great picture quality. I am actually preferring this setup with 4 18\" screens vs two standard 27\" monitor side-by-side; no part of the screens seem farway. The brightness is great for indoor use, I have not tried them outdoors. My primary use for these is development and they work great for that and with the 144Hz great for gaming too. Text is crisp and readable and the contrast is great with really deep blacks. I thought I would need to increase font size to be able to read well on these but even with 2k resolution the default font sizes are easily readable. I have not noticed any ghosting or other artifacts when gaming or watching videos. I can not speak for color accuracy as that is not really my wheelhouse, but to the untrained eye it seems fine.\n\nI have had a few minor issues with them, but nothing that really matters. When using sound via DisplayPort on the monitors, if more than one is connected, they go into a reset loop whenever sound tries to play. The speakers are pretty poor anyway so I was not planning on using them. They do work though if you are only using one screen for travel. The other issue is that sometimes the screens do not turn on and need the power plugged and unplugged before they work. This seems to happen if you disconnect the DP or HDMI.\n\nIf you are using these with a graphics card with DP out, make sure to double check the DP-USB3 cable you buy. Most are uni-directional in the wrong way. UPERFECT gave me a suggestion of which one will work and reimbursed me for 2 of the 3 I needed. I have actually contacted their support multiple times getting this non-traditional setup going and they have been prompt and thorough in their replies. Also you will not get the 144Hz over HDMI, but that is HDMI's fault not the monitors.\n\nOverall I think these are a great value and would recommend them for various different uses.",

It’s perfect for when you’re on the go, or for my use case recently, which would be working on final research essay and interacting with multiple digital books while working out of state for my job.\n\nThe screen has a metal frame that feels premium and seems durable. The folding magnetic cover also holds the screen upright quite well.\n\nThe colors out of the box are pretty impressive, even though I have not used a color calibrator on it yet.\n\nAdditionally, if you have any questions about the monitor or about any of UPERFECT’s other products, their customer service is pretty helpful.\n\nIf you need a carrying case for the monitor, UPERFECT also sells an 18.5” carrying case that’s, well, perfect. It has a zipper pocket where you can carry the three cables it comes with.\n\n//// Some additional helpful notes ////\n\n— USB-C CABLES: Be sure to use at least a certified USB 3.1 or higher cable (USB 4, Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, etc)! Not all USB-C cables are created equal. If you use a lower-rated cable such as USB 3.0, the monitor won’t work. The two included USB 3.1 cables are perfect!\n\n— BRIGHTNESS SETTING: To save a brightness setting, connect the monitor to a power source with the second included USB 3.1 cable and the included 15W power brick, then set your brightness settings afterwards. If the monitor doesn’t receive its own power, it will by default turn on dim, and you can adjust the brightness afterwards. It is not a big issue for me. I just make sure my laptop is connected to sufficient power, connect the monitor to my laptop with a single USB 3.1 or higher cable, and adjust the brightness setting back up quickly.",

Pretty robust monitor settings for adjusting color properties to your liking.\n\nThe one drawback (and for me it's pretty significant) is the backlight bleed at the bottom left corner where the ports are located. It is very distracting in dark scenes (both movies and gaming) but not very noticeable otherwise. This is caused by a bit too much pressure of the plastic bezel on the screen, especially in this corner due to the presence of the ports and pcb. I alleviated this by removing two of the bottom screws near that corner and using a plastic wedge to pry the corner open a tiny bit. Boom, backlight bleed is completely gone. There is also some backlight bleed in both upper corners, but not nearly as problematic. Plus you can't realistically remove that many screws anyways.

Object movement and transitions are so clear now that I wish I could upgrade all of my monitors to this high of a resolution and framerate. Much regret.\n\nThe colors are damn vibrant and this monitor would be better for productivity and games with bright settings or takes place in the day. Obviously, if you want to play games with dark settings or takes place more at night, you should look into OLED monitors.\n\nThat being said, default settings are alright. Once i turned on freesync and adjusted some settings, everything started to pop more and this started really feeling like a premium experience.\n\nThe design of the monitor itself is pretty simple and clean. Decently thin bezel and no unnecessary brand logo in the front to distract you from the great screen itself. The port connections placement (bottom left) is perfect for my setup, but for others it might be an issue. According to the manual, users can just change the orientation 180° to switch the ports onto the top right corner instead.\n\nSpeakers: Only useful in a setting where youre actually using the portable feature and taking this monitor out, but if you're using this monitor every day at your desk, better to use your own speakers or a headset. I really didn't get this monitor for it's speakers, but since it is an included feature, I have to deduct 1 star from it because the speakers do suck.

This monitor is great, but you just need to be aware of the size. I also have the 15.6inch from this same company. I compare everything against my 5.11 backpacks as that is what I pack everything into. The 18inch fits nicely in the Rush24 but sticks out some with the Rush12 and the Moab10. This has been fine for short trips. The 15.6 fits fine into all three backpacks. With that said, I have found myself reaching for the 18inch and my Moab10 and just packing everything into that. It seems to fit fairly nice and secure even with it sticking out slightly. It has become my go-to grab-and-go when heading out for short trips. I am able to fit my extra keyboard, mouse, monitor and laptop in the Moab10 when I was heading to the library for a change of scenery (or when my internet goes out). As long as you have the space for carrying this around, you can't go wrong.\n\nWith regards to setup, this works great with my Surface Laptop 3 and 4. The power from the USB-C is sufficient so the extra power cable is not required. I find this to be extremely appealing and super simple for setup. I also recently ordered the Surface dock as I would like to have use of both monitors. (FYI, Surface Laptop only comes with 1 USB-C port).\n\nThe monitor is 2k so it is clear and has really good resolution. I found it to be a great compliment to my work laptop (which is only a 13inch). Being a Software Engineer, the extra desktop space is a must. I have had several multi-hour runs with it recently because our internet kept going out. I found myself constantly moving my windows over to the 18inch and working from that screen and only keeping email and chat on my laptop monitor.\n\nIf you are in the market and have the space for carrying this around then the 18inch is the way to go. If you are limited on space then you might consider the 15.6inch version but again, you can really see the difference between 15.6 and 18inch with regards to how much you can fit on your screen. In all honesty, you really can't go wrong either way as the company is wonderful and stands by their products.",

			"title": "Very portable, can charge laptop via PD, not usable as a TB3 dock, overall works very well",
			"body": "For some context, I bought this product to replace a portable monitor I had before.\n\nThe monitor I used to have was working perfectly fine, but this one was better in the following ways:\n1. Portability - smaller, fits in a backpack folio pocket, and doesn't actually need a stand, since I can use a pen.\n2. Sleekness - my previous monitor had gigantic bezels, and didn't look nearly as good as this one.\n3. Performance - maybe I'm just imagining it, but this display seems to have less delay than the previous one I had to the point where there's no perceptible difference to the laptop's display.\n4. Functionality - I don't care about the HDMI + DisplayPort ports, but I can see other people finding them useful. I do care about the PD (power delivery) port on the display, and the fact that the display has power passthrough. That was a huge problem for me with my previous display since I was connecting it over USB-C to a laptop with only one USB-C port, so I wouldn't have a port to charge it with. Now I can charge it via the display.\n\nCons:\n1. This has been the most frustrating part for me - confusing marketing / documentation. I wanted to know if the PD port would provide pass-through power to the laptop, and despite all my research, and asking questions, and getting confusing responses, I couldn't determine it. I had to just buy the display, and try it out. Further, you don't actually need thunderbolt 3 for this monitor to function, it seems like it just uses USB3 + DP alt-mode (you do need a USB-C port for DP alt-mode). This means it should work on laptops that don't have thunderbolt 3, but have USB-C ports. You also shouldn't need the more expensive tb3 cables, if you're looking for a better cable than the included ones. The fact that the package also includes a card giving a free gift for 5 star reviews is also really sketchy, and makes me not really trust the amazon reviews - a pity too, since the monitor is legitimately pretty great.\n2. Speakers are pretty crappy - they're even worst than laptop speakers, I don't see myself having a use case for them.\n3. The backplate isn't super well attached to the rest of the body, and you can see some flex, and a gap around the edges - I'll have to figure something out to seal it in place.\n\nThis isn't really a con, but more of a wish-list feature: I travel quite a bit for work, and that's the main reason I got this display - I wanted something that would be easy to take on a plane, but also powerful enough to do serious work on (I code for a living). When I do get to my destinations, I tend to have a screen available for me to use. It would be extremely nice if this portable screen at that point could serve as a central dock for everything - it already serves as one for USB (although from what I read it seems to be USB 2.0, which isn't super great, but I haven't tested that part), but it would be amazing if the displayport + hdmi ports could also work as outputs when using the type-c connection. The ports are already there, you probably don't need a lot of extra hardware to make it work with MST (Multi Stream Transport), and it would be a killer feature, especially at this price point, since it could effectively replace some docks that cost as much or more than this screen alone.\n\nOverall this is a pretty cool screen - bright, good colors, IPS, sleek, super-portable, I really like the pen hole, and the fact that I can pass-through charge my laptop is great, and really fits my use case. UPERFECT really nailed it here - there are a lot of other monitors at a similar price point that are either missing the PD port, or the pen hole, this one has it all. Only missing the killer feature of making it a full-feature dock by making the mini-DP + HDMI inputs also work as outputs when using type-C.",

The ThinkPad is able to run it from a single USB-C port (no separate power cable needed for my setup) with the included USB-C cable. It also came with an HDMI to mini-HDMI cable and a USB-A to USB-C cable for power. The case/stand is fine but not anything to write home about. I would have preferred something more like the Microsoft Surface adjustable kickstands, but that probably would have added a lot to the price. I honestly think they made the right compromise here.\n\nIt worked out of the box with Ubuntu just fine. The only thing weird there is that Ubuntu seems to detect the monitor as a 27\" screen instead of 13.3\" so it doesn't default to HiDPI mode. Once I set it to 2x scaling though, everything looks great. The speakers are actually louder than my laptop speakers but sound a bit tinnier. They're fine for playing some backgroumd music or watching a YouTube video. it's nice that they're included, and really they don't sound half bad considering the price and small size.\n\nI bought this to use with a ThinkPad Z13 so I had some extra screen real estate available when working from the road.

There's a pressable 2-way rocker switch and a separate \"back\" button. Pressing the rocker switch brings up the menu and navigation is simple and quick. There's actually a really cool quirk (which might even be described in the instruction manual that I didn't read): if you flip the rocker switch up or down when the full OSD *isn't* displayed, it directly controls: audio volume, brightness or input source depending on which one you last adjusted in the main OSD menu. It's a bit weird, but actually really useful in practice.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it.",

No complaints with the hardware or the packaging.\nIt can be powered by a laptop, but it won't get very bright by default (brightness 1) and the sound will be unacceptable. You can increase brightness, which is great. A brightness level of 2 is plenty in an office.\n\nIt can be powered by the adapter + USB-C cable that come in the box, and it will get VERY bright by default (brightness level 10). I reduced brightness to 2); the sound will be acceptable—nothing to write home about, but loud and decent.\n\nConnected to Windows, It runs at 2560 x 1600 with recommended 100% scaling, but for me text is too small, so I run it at 150% scaling, and it all works great.\n\nNow, connected to a Mac (I have a 2016 MacBook Pro) is a different story in the sense that the default resolution makes text small, and any other resolution makes text big and fuzzy. There is no scaling option like on Windows, so you are kind of forced to run it at 2560 x 1600 (comparable to Windows with scaling of 100%), which gives you a lot of screen real estate, but makes text very small—great if you are an eagle, not so great if you are not. I think it also maxes out at 120 Hz on Mac compared to 144 Hz on Windows.\n\nWith the Mac caveat above, it's a truly great display.",

I'm convinced you can't find more features on an 18\" monitor at this price point! Large, Lightweight yet compact (Fits in my monitor case for 17.3\" monitor). Beautiful color, High Pixel Density, Excellent Contrast and Brightness, Very High Refresh Rate and Freesync. This monitor is perfectly suited for most any task.\n\nFor Gamers...\nThis is a beautiful Gaming monitor with a FreeSync Range of 60-120Hz via HDMI and 60-144Hz via USB-C.\nThe monitor doesn't support Low Frame Rate Compensation (LFC). This would only affect serious gamers who push their game settings to the limit and drive their frame Rate below the minimum Freesync Range (You know who you are!) If this is not you, you'll enjoy the high frequency refresh rate.\n\nOutstanding Customer Service!\nUPerfect's customer service is remarkable. They are quick to respond, professional, concerned about accuracy and PATIENT! I contacted UPerfect for a couple of items that were spelled out in the manual. They patiently responded though I had overlooked what I was looking for.\nWhen I purchased the monitor on Aug 8, 2023 the description read that the monitor incorporated FreeSync Premium. After receiving the monitor, I questioned UPerfect about this. Customer service contacted engineering and confirmed the monitor, in fact, was not FreeSync Premium. It is standard FreeSync. Within a couple days the description had been updated and there is no more confusion. What more could you want?!\nBeautiful monitor, great price point and additional $20 coupon (at time of this review).\nIf you need a compact monitor, this one is wonderful!",

Although you can mount it on a Vesa stand. Definitely recommend for working/Gaming on the go or having a smaller but large enough display to supplement WFH.

I can’t say enough about the product, but I’m also just as happy with UPERFECT’s service.

The older 16 inch monitor doesn't give out such a warning message.\n\nHow I have it typically set up is the 18 inch model as a primary gaming screen through the single type C cable to my laptop and the 16 inch model through the mini-HDMI to HDMI on my laptop as a secondary screen. Both of these UPerfect monitors support Freesync/GSync and through testing, both exhibit absolutely zero screen tear and response time are both excellent. The newer screen doesn't get as bright as the older one, which is not surprising since the 16 inch model is advertised at 500 nits. No big deal, the 18 inch model gets plenty bright.\n\nI also noticed a plus for the 18 inch model is that UPerfect redesigned the rubber protective cover so the monitor stands more firmly on it with extra grip. The older 16 inch model has a cover that doesn't grip the monitor when standing up and I was always nervous that it would topple over. Still looking for a good sturdy stand for both of these.

This came recommended by Bitwit, a famous Tech Youtube. Man, if anything, I think he understated this product in his review!\nThe monitor comes with a case, which Bitwit and I agree on being an excellent case; however, the ability to stand the monitor with a pen is surprisingly both more convenient and more effective in most cases!\nMeanwhile, the 1080P Full HD at this price is competitive with other monitors. Additionally, the price is pretty fantastic, around $170 at the time of writing, with its lowest price ever having been about $140 closer to its initial release.\nAdding to that, however, is the fact you get:\n\nthree cables with two reusable bags(about $10-15 each in value, USB to USB C[Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Spec], USBC to USBC, HDMI to HDMI),\na case (another $10 in value),\na screen protector (Yet another $10)\nand a standard wall charger with a USB output.\n\nThat's over $50 worth of value in included accessories. Very impressive.\n\nCost-saving measures/tech limitations to note:\n1) The cords don't fit tightly into the monitor ports or don't go all the way in. Personally, this cost-saving measure annoys me; however, after getting the monitor setup, I tend to forget about it as I focus on actually using the monitor.\n\n2) You need to plug the monitor into the wall-charger as well when you want to make it save your settings. Then you won't need to plug it in again until you want to change what it defaults back to. Otherwise, it will default to 30% brightness, etc.\n\n3) It's not true HDR (Not expected at this price); however, with proper tweaking, you could probably make it look decent. I don't put the care into tweaking. Instead, I leave the HDR on auto for regular use.\n\n4) The response time is 3-5 ms. Not the 1-2 ms you would want for professional gaming on this particular screen; however, that's not necessarily whom this product is targeted toward.\n\nTips before you buy:\n1. Check to make sure your device is compatible with the inputs/outputs used! If it's not, consider emailing the manufacturer to see if they can customize the monitor specific to your needs. (I have not used that particular service as of yet)\n\n2. I would suggest emailing the manufacturer to ensure you understand how to apply the screen protector properly. I didn't; however, I let UPERFECT know, and upon receiving my order number & address, they immediately sent out a replacement screen protector. They even emailed a clear visual graphic with instructions on how to apply it correctly.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to ask UPERFECT questions you have with the monitor. They seem both friendly and prepared to answer your questions effectively, responding within a day even now.\n\nOverall breakdown: of why I compare this to an 'Apple-like' experience for a fraction of the price:\nFantastic Customer Service reminiscent of Apple's\nIncluded Accessories of a level reminiscent of classic Apple\nFunctionality for a price lower or similar to that of its competitors\nSpeakers & Graphics of an excellent quality & sound level\nIt just works.\n\nEnjoy :)",

			"title": "Hidden Gem in the Portable Monitor World",
			"body": "I've been on the search for a good portable monitor for about the last 1-2 years to use as both a portable larger screen for gaming (Android Phone or Switch) as well as a portable monitor for working while on the road or away from my typical desk setup. I use Microsoft Surface products which have pretty great monitors so the bar was already set pretty high, since the portable monitor sits right next to the Surface device in my setup.\n\nI had seen a couple of reviews praising this monitor from Uperfect but had to see it for myself. In a few short words I was blown away. I'll list a few of the great features:\n- the monitor is very bright, especially when using the supplied AC adapter or other high wattage supply. One great feature, when the power being supplied is weaker, the monitor sets a lower brightness to allow it to function regardless.\n- the colors are rich and vibrant, even when compared to the Surface device or my vibrant phone screen.\n- after having used a few portable monitors and other devices needing micro-HDMI, mini-HDMI etc. it was an amazing convenience to just plug a standard HDMI into this monitor. A great feature I didn't know I wanted.\n- the monitor settings control uses a series of buttons, NOT joysticks or rotary wheels that break and are delicate as seen on other brands. I have high confidence that these buttons will last and not be damaged when transporting the monitor (as seen on other brands). This is a PORTABLE monitor after all.\n- the 13.3 inch size is surprisingly small and portable yet large enough to be very useable. I should mention that the overall monitor is also very light, making it even more portable.\n- other little features that make this monitor flexible and convenient for any use: micro-usb passthrough for using wired keyboard/mice, 2X USB-C (one for signal, one for power), mini-display port (Mac) and the headphone jack if your device doesn't already have one (typical these days), the body is metal giving more confidence in the overall durability.\n- when propping the monitor up for use, I find it easy to use the pencil method or if I need more angle variability I use my Moko stand (small and easy to transport). Since the monitor is so light (no battery) any light duty stand will do.\n\nThe only downvote and it's very minor is that the case is pretty cheap and not very useable. I'm working with Uperfect to remedy this.\n\nBecause the picture and overall quality are so high, I'm really looking forward to an eventual update of this monitor with a higher refresh rate (120Hz), and touch input, but keeping the same size, if they decide to go down that route.\n\nHighly recommended for your PC, Phone, Nintendo Switch (with dock of course), Raspberry Pi, SFFPC and uses I haven't realized yet. It's so refreshing to see a brand finally get this right!",

This 18-inch marvel has exceeded all my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with its performance.\n\nFirst and foremost, the UPERFECT monitor boasts an 18-inch large screen that's not only visually stunning but also incredibly easy on the eyes. The blue light filtering, anti-glare, and flicker-free design are real lifesavers for those long hours of work or gaming. The reduction in eye strain is immediately noticeable, and it's something that I've come to truly appreciate.\n\nIf you're a gaming enthusiast like me, you'll be delighted to know that this monitor delivers an outstanding gaming experience. The 2K resolution at 144Hz refresh rate ensures crystal-clear images and smooth gameplay. No lags, no ghosting—just pure gaming bliss. AMD FreeSync and HDR technology further enhance the visuals, immersing you in a world of gaming like never before. Whether you're into fast-paced shooters or immersive RPGs, this monitor has you covered.\n\nThe UPERFECT monitor doesn't just excel in gaming; it's also a powerhouse for professional tasks. The 100% DCI-P3 color gamut IPS matte screen delivers stunning visuals with accurate colors and wide viewing angles. I've found it perfect for photo editing, design work, and multimedia experiences. The matte finish is not only visually pleasing but also practical, as it reduces glare and ensures a comfortable viewing experience in any lighting condition.",

And I prefer a smaller screen so I don't have to move my head around as much.\n\nThe initial screen I was sent had an issue with light leak. I emailed UPERFECT support and they were extremely helpful in identifying the issue, and they immediately sent me out a new monitor before I sent the old one back.

I have updated my review based on the company's service and efforts to resolve my issues with the product - I would buy from UPERFECT again based on this experience.\n\nEDIT: watch out for relying on reviews as a purchase determination - this seller attempts hard to offer incentives for 5 star reviews. I purchased this one based on overwhelmingly positive reviews to learn it is not an overwhelmingly positive product so be warned if relying on the reviews. I do not think it is necessarily a poor product but it seems way overpriced for what it is - pick it up for $50 and it's a good value - @ $180 there are better alternatives on the market and this thing does not \"feel\" like a $180 monitor in 2021.\n\nNot a lot of options in the 13in size so I picked up this one and another brand for my spouse and I to work from home while traveling. This one was tested and worked with a Dell XPS13 and was used for a week with a MacBook Air. It functioned well for the week. It did seem to power of the laptop battery using the USB-C but and external power was also used some. Functionally, it does work and did include cords and adapters. It was packaged like a premium product but did not feel premium at all.\n\nThis thing is thick, like overly thick for what it is. It is about as thick as the whole laptop so I don't know what it was made to be that way. We are keeping it because my spouse states she likes that if has some heft to it so she doesn't feel like it is going to break.\n\nI would not recommend this thing, at least not at the price they have on it. It seems like a cheap build all around but it does work as intended. Not a lot of options in the 13in portable monitor category so prices seem to be inflated a bit.\n\nI would not recommend this portable screen, there are better builds out there.",

My screensaver has a lot of deep reds and pinks, and each hue came through beautifully.\n\nThe monitor came without any issues. I experienced some green, galaxy-like, dots during early usage, but that was because I was using a bad hdmi splitter. That being said, depending on your power source(s), you might only get 120hz instead of 144, so be mindful of the equipment you use. It has two USB Type C ports and a Mini HDMI cable.\n\nI switched to this monitor from a 4k 28\" monitor, and I honestly believe this one is better. The screen size and resolution make it comfortable for me to use for daily hobbies and tasks. I don't strain when reading text, and games have practically no aliasing issues. It really suits me.\n\nFinally, I used it on my Xbox Series X. It's compatible with the 1440p 120hz setting. I would definitely recommend this one.",

I can put a test paper to grade on one screen and the answer key on the other and now I don't have to print out the answer key to grade a paper anymore.\n\nAfter reading through many many reviews I was under the impression that I would be able to power this monitor using the USB port of the Surface Pro 6 and use the DisplayPort to connect to the USB-C port on the monitor. Things just didn't work like that for me. Powering the monitor using a different USB power block took care of that part and while I did get the DisplayPort to USB-C working, I eventually switched to a DisplayPort to HDMI cable for better results. Still having issues that I will not blame on the monitor or the cables I decided to try an HDMI Wireless dongle to utilize Miracast from the tablet. This has become my standard set up now but I must say it won't work for everyone because using the Miracast causes lag in videos and I think it would not do well for gaming either but that is not a reflection of the monitor itself.\n\nThe monitor is great and they sent a free case that doubles as a stand. I cannot really match the settings to the tablet's screen but that really isn't a priority for me and I guess with some time and patience and a good bit of tweaking you could get the two monitors pretty close but you will always have the matt finish of the monitor and the glossy finish of the tablet.\n\nI also believed from the description that the monitor had another USB port that would allow a hub like connection to another USB device. But that was just my misunderstanding.\n\nIf there were anything I would change it would be the location of the HDMI and other plug-in points moved to the middle instead of the corners. Maybe even a second set of plug-in points on either the top or bottom to allow for easier use in portrait mode. A way to wirelessly cast to this monitor, instead of having to use a separate dongle, would really make this monitor a leader in its class. I have no knowledge of a small travel monitor like this that has wireless built-in but that would be great.\n\nOverall, I love this monitor and I would buy it again and I would really like to get one or even two more in the future just to have the ultimate setup. I will and already have recommended this to friends and associates and shared what limitations surfaced in my configuration. I haven't used it with my MacBook Pro or any other devices yet but I have no reason to suspect anything will go wrong, especially if your source is HDMI.",

If you use is to mirror your phone and you don't plug in the dedicated power supply, then yeah, it's way more dim. But with it fully powered this thing rocks.\n\nI also discovered that Samsung Dex will run on this monitor even without the external power supply. That was a nice surprise. (This was tested on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra)\n\nSpeakers get loud enough to annoy my wife. Sound quality is better that expected as well. Granted it's not like it has a sound bar built in, but it is true stereo sound, and loud enough to fill a small room.\n\nColors render well. I 100% believe the manufacturer's claims about the color accuracy. Contrast ratio ia a little lacking, I think, but it's not an OLED or AMOLED screen, so taking that into consideration, the contrast ratio is decent. You'll definitely be impressed with what this thing offers.\n\nWhat's in the box?\n- A rubber case that folds into a stand (this case attaches to the back of the unit by magnets, but there are no magnets on the front to hold it closed when you fold it up to put it away)\n- A full size HDMI to full size HDMI cable (about 1 meter)\n- A USB-C to USB-C cable (about 1 meter)\n- A USB-C to USB-A cable (about 1 meter)\n- A 5v 3A power brick with USB-A connector\n- A screen protector\n- A squeegee to help apply the screen protector\n\nAvailable Ports:\nLeft side:\n- 1 Micro USB (like the old android phone charger becore USB-C)\n\nRight Side\n- 1 USB-C port for power delivery (this does not accept a video feed. I tried.)\n- 1 USB-C port for power and data (this one does video, and it will charge your phone. It'll also charge your laptop if your laptop supports that.)\n- 1 3.5mm headphone jack\n- 1 Mini Displayport\n- 1 Full size HDMI\n\nI only gave this a 4 star rating because the build quality just seems a little more flimsy that I was hoping for.

It connects via magnets, which help you align with the monitor easily. The main issue I have with the cover is that it's not the toughest material. It will keep your monitor up right and it's very secure in that sense, but when not in use and you are transporting this monitor, the cover won't protect it if something heavy is on top of it. The monitor itself has a plastic film over it, instead of a glass cover, like most monitors, but I think that keeps the price and physical weight down.\n\nVESA mount is awesome and rare to find with any portable monitor.

I have been using this this 18-inch 144Hz 2K portable monitor for over a month, and I must say, it's been amazing.\n\nAmazing resolution with big screen:\nIn my daily routine, I primarily use this monitor for coding, watching videos, and gaming, and it's the perfect companion for all these tasks. Whether I'm at Starbucks or any other place, it effortlessly transforms into my office.\n\nSolid Build:\nI gotta say the build quality is really impressive. It feels durable and well-constructed. The frame of this monitor is metal, so it stably holds the big monitor. This gives it a premium feel and ensures it can withstand the rigors of travel or daily use.\n\nWhether you're coding, watching videos, gaming, or even video editing, this monitor will be perfect choice because of its brilliant image quality, fast refresh rate, premium build.",

			"title": "Good monitor, all the ports!",
			"body": "**Update**\nUPERFECT support rep reached out and notified me they had a different case that does fold so you don't have a big flap sticking out in front of the monitor. Raising my rating by a star for great support.\n\n** Original Review **\n\nI'm reviewing this from the perspective of using with a laptop, which is my only use. The stand / case it comes with is pretty bad. The grooves the monitor would rest in are too small and the monitor moves around a lot. Just as important, you have a big front lip of the case coming out from the screen, so you can't line it up very close to your laptop and angle it because the case won't slide under your laptop (at least my laptop). I also have the asus portable monitor and that case design that uses magnets is much better and the case doesn't get in the way when trying to get it as close to your laptop screen as possible.\n\nAlso, it's a bit thick to fit into those cheap little tablet stands.\n\nA couple other things that would make this monitor better for using as second display with laptop. The usb c ports don't feel as secure as they should as the cable sticks out a little bit - e.g. you see some of the metal connector showing when the cable is plugged in. I'd prefer the connection was a tighter fit and had less play.\n\nLastly, I would prefer one of the usb c ports to be on a different side. This would give you flexibility in what side of your laptop you want to use the monitor. I prefer the monitor to the left of my laptop screen, which is where the power and display usb c cables connect. It's pretty clunky and you need a good amount of space for cables between the monitor and the laptop display - almost all portable monitors have the ports on one side so this is not unique to this monitor.\n\nThe display itself is pretty good at full brightness and is matte (without included screen protector) which is nice. The port selection is also great! Better than some full size desktop monitors.\n\nUltimately, I wish more portable monitors would use a kickstand style design and move some of the ports to the back of the display.",

			"title": "Portable Monitor Perfection: Sleek, High-Quality, and Convenient!",
			"body": "I recently purchased a portable monitor and I have been extremely impressed with its performance. The picture quality is top-notch and the size and weight of the monitor make it very convenient to take on the go. I use it primarily for work, but it has also been a great addition to my home entertainment setup. The setup was a breeze and the included instructions made it easy to get everything up and running quickly. The monitor also has a slim and sleek design, which makes it look great on my desk and saves space in my bag when I'm on the go.\nI had a few questions about the monitor and I was able to reach out to the customer service team with ease. They had very quick and helpful responses and were very professional and kind over email as well.\nOne of the features that really stands out to me is the adjustable viewing angle. I can easily adjust the angle of the screen to find the most comfortable and ergonomic position, which has really helped to reduce eye strain and fatigue during long work sessions. I also like that the monitor comes with built in speakers as well, because my main monitor did not have speakers, so I had been using my headphones.\nI used it thorough the mini-HDMI cable and the USB-C cable and it worked perfectly as I intended.\nOverall, I highly recommend this portable monitor to anyone in need of an additional display for work or play. It has exceeded my expectations and has become an invaluable tool in my daily life. Five stars!",

I like it's big (18\") and at the same time it's perfectly fit in my backpack.\nAnother great thing what I like is, you don't even have to use power supply for it. You can use 1 USB-C cable to you laptop and that's it. If you will use mini-hdmi connection than you will use power supply. It has speakers, I do use them (sometimes) vs built-in in the laptop. The picture quality is great, plug and play (very easy to get it connected), easy to set it up on your desk. I do use it even at home if I work out side of my office. Great product.",

			"title": "Better than I expected with a few drawbacks",
			"body": "Overall the device looks well built and the image is much better than I had expected. The panel itself has solid contrast, good brightness and pleasing color reproduction. It's not embarrassing next to a Retina display iMac which has one of the better displays on any desktop available. There are a few issues I had with mine that I've decided to accept at this price point and contribute to the overall 3-star rating.\n1) LCD Mount - The upper right hand corner of the screen doesn't appear to be mounted in the housing very well. If you gently press on it (as I did while attempting to install the screen protector) it will deflect. While not an issue when in use, it does make me wonder if it will become an issue in the future given that the screen moves a bit while transporting\n2) Screen protector - What can I say other than after three tries to align it properly I have a piece of lint under the middle of the screen and a 1/2 inch bubble that I can't remove. The screen protector is simply too large to put on easily like one would do with a cell phone and it should be installed at the factory. If they included a glass protector it would be a lot easier to line up, but the thin plastic is just too hard to get aligned. I may attempt to remove the lint but I'm concerned about damaging the screen itself in the process. There were a number of other bubbles that I mostly removed with the included squeegee. There are still a handful of small bubbles left and I'm undecided as to how I'll correct these.\n3) Freesync support - While I knew that this was a 60Hz panel, it's clear that on my machine it only supports Freesync between 50-60Hz. At least that's what the AMD control panel told me.\n4) Display sync - I've had issues with display sync when running fullscreen games. They work perfectly in fullscreen windowed mode, but will not function in fullscreen mode. The symptom is one where the screen will power off and on again. I don't believe it's a power delivery issue as I'm plugged into a 100W thunderbolt port",

			"title": "Excellent 2nd/portable monitor",
			"body": "I purchased this to use as a 2nd monitor with my work laptop to make working from home more comparable to working in my office with dual monitors. I’m using the mini display port connection with USB C providing power through the supplied AC adapter.\nThis seems to have enough connections to satisfy every scenario and the metal casing is much nicer and sturdier than the plastic case which is what I was expecting. I appreciate that it ships with various cobles and the AC adapter. The box and packaging are first class. This does not come across as a cheap item. Everything about it speaks to quality and a well thought out design.\nUSB C to HDMI works great to mirror my Samsung Galaxy S10 screen if I want to stream a video at a larger size. I could not get a USB C to USB C connection to work on its own for the phone so must always use the AC adapter for power.\nThis is really nice 1080p screen. At 13.3 inches it can be a bit challenging to read text, but the clarity and sharpness are excellent. I sit close enough so this really isn’t an issue. Overall, it’s a better screen than on my laptop. There is no glare and the viewing angle is vastly better.\nColors are bright and saturated. Brightness and contrast work well with Office apps and videos.\n\nThe foldable stand is thin but has slots for two different viewing angles which is a nice touch. I did not try angling the monitor with a pen through the hole as shown, so I cannot say if it works, but I’m not sure I would attempt it anyway.\nThe speakers are tiny but are clear enough if needed; otherwise attach headphones.\n\nThe instructions are somewhat lacking so understanding the functionality of the buttons can be frustrating until you get a handle on it. Lots of embedded menus with a wealth of adjustability, but be prepared to spend some time working out the button logic within a given menu screen.\nI reviewed many options in this category and decided on the 13.3 inch instead of 15.6 inch to keep things more compact on my desk at home. This monitor meets all of my needs at a decent price.",

			"title": "I've had both the 13\" 1080P and the Superthin 13\" 1080P",
			"body": "I originally ordered the ultra-thin 13\" 1080P monitor, but returned it because within 12 hours of having it sit on my desk the back panel was coming unglued from the housing. I liked the product so much (thin, sleek, and great case) that I almost re-ordered the same thing. However, after reading more of the reviews, I decided to try the standard (non-thin) 13\" 1080P. I used both of these with a single usb-c plugged into a 2017 13\" MacBook Pro. Here are my thoughts:\n\nPro's for the standard (non-thin) 13\" 1080P:\n1) Picture is brighter and better (better and brighter than any portable monitor i've tried - quite a few).\n2) Housing is metal and feels solid (although light).\n3) Matte display.\n\nCon's for the standard (non-thin) 13\" 1080P:\n1) No included carrying case (BIG con, in my opinion).\n2) Stand is crap.\n3) The pen hole (which is supposed to serve as an on-the-go stand option) is not angled at all. Therefore, if you try to use it, the monitor will basically be 90° to the table surface, which is very impractical. I suppose if you find an ultra-thin pen it will be able to angle due to spacing in the pen-hole, but don't hold your breath.\n\nPro's for the ultra-thin 13\" 1080P:\n1) Very thin and therefore very sleek looking and feeling.\n2) Metal housing feels relatively strong (although light as well).\n3) Picture quality and brightness are still decent.\n4) Comes with a beautiful, magnetic, fitted carrying case that also operates as a stand.\n\nCon's for the ultra-thin 13\" 1080P:\n1) Picture quality and brightness not as good as the standard.\n2) Housing glue may not hold up well (not sure if this pertains to all, or just the one I had).\n3) Glossy screen\n\nThe menu options and buttons are terrible for both, but I don't really need to go into the menu for anything so not too big a deal. I purchased a separate tablet stand on Amazon that made the standard, non-thin actually usable. It's unfortunate the standard, non-thin version has more con's because the thing that's most important (screen brightness and quality) are best. For that reason, I'll likely keep the standard, non-thin version if I can find a good carrying case.\n\nUpdate: Upgrading from 3 to 5 stars just because of the outstanding customer service provided by the Uperfect team. They reached out to make sure I was satisfied with their product.",

			"body": "This is a wonderful monitor. I primarily use it for my Raspberry Pi projects and working on PCs where I don't have a lot of space to set up. I'm always pleased with the quality when I work on it. While it's not the greatest, it definitely does well considering all the other features it has. It even works with Samsung Dex on my Galaxy S8. To do this I used the included power adapter plugged into the monitor, then the included USB-C to USB-C cable from the monitor to my GS8. It even keeps the phone charged. I could see it being a great travel companion with a USB-C equipped (and supported) phone or laptop. The build quality is great, and would definitely hold up during travel in my opinion.\n\nProbably one of my biggest gripes about this product was the stand. I purchased this monitor about a year ago before they started providing the folio stand with it. It came with a little wire stand that was a little on the cheap side, but it worked I suppose. I found my way onto this Amazon listing again and I saw it came with a folio case! I reached out to the company to ask if there was a way to purchase one, and they generously offered to send one for free! They were quick about the whole thing. Really great customer service.\n\nNow that I have the folio stand, this thing really shines. It makes for setting up even easier than the little wire stand, and I'd feel confident taking it somewhere in my laptop case.\n\nThere are speakers, and while I'd probably never use them for much, they're handy to have. The headphone jack is a nice touch too. I will admit when testing it out I could hear a little ringing, sometimes from the unit's speakers, and sometime from the headphones. Not important for me personally, but thought I'd share that.\n\nOverall a great item to have on hand. In my case, it definitely has been used enough to make it a worthwhile purchase.",
