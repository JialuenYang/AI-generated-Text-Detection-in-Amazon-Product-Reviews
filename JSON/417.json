This keyboard breaks the mold and is great through and through. The LED is too bright for me, so I disabled it, and the slope at the front of the keyboard is useless to me personally, but the keyboard itself is worth it and more.\n\nYou'll never key a key that is crooked and won't go down, the letters and numbers stay on very well, and if you want a specific color to cool... you can do that too. All of the keys are very responsive and I am happy to say it doesn't require any dumb software to get started - unless you want to change the colors a bunch - and even that software is fine.\n\nI purchased two of these now (one for my kid) and even at this point - if anything goes wrong with it, I'd buy another with a smile for how well it has performed through gaming and countless emails - and amazon reviews haha!",

			"title": "Perfect keystroke feel",
			"body": "As an avid gamer, I've always been on the lookout for a keyboard that can keep up with my fast-paced gaming sessions, and this keyboard delivers in every aspect. With its matte black finish and RGB backlighting, it instantly adds a touch of sophistication to my gaming setup. The keys are perfectly spaced and have just the right amount of resistance, making typing and gaming incredibly comfortable.\n\nOne of my favorite features of this keyboard is the hybrid mechanical switches. They combine the tactile feedback of a mechanical switch with the soft cushioned feel of a membrane switch. This unique combination provides a satisfying typing experience without compromising on comfort.\n\nAnother great feature is the fully programmable macro keys. With these customizable keys, I can assign complex actions or shortcuts to a single key press, giving me a competitive edge in games. It's incredibly convenient and has saved me countless keystrokes.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I would say that the Ornata V3 X could benefit from dedicated media controls. While it does have media function keys integrated into the top row, having dedicated buttons would make adjusting volume or skipping tracks easier during gameplay.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with my new keyboard and don't see myself replacing it anytime soon.",

I got another cheaper-ish keyboard from a different company, and it was horrible. Everything was wrong. The keys were too big. It hurt to type and still I put off investing in a new one of these.\nNow that I have one again, I'm sad I waited so long. I actually enjoy typing again and don't get so frustrated with all the mistakes. I'd rather risk replacing this one every year than use whatever the other keyboard I had was. Hopefully that first one was just a fluke. I can't say I always take the best care of my equipment, so it could be on me too.\nWe'll see.",

			"title": "It’s good, but not perfect…for the price",
			"body": "Pros:\n\n• Nice, sleek design\n• Keys feel nice to type on (for membrane keys anyway) as in they have a pleasant feedback and the keys’ surface is pleasantly soft to the touch\n• The RGB backlighting can get super bright, which I am not used to. I like the option to change it. I’m not used to that option for a keyboard.\n• Worked right away with Windows 10 without Razer software\n• The cable routing option underneath the keyboard was an unexpected surprise. Nice touch Razer!\n\nCons:\n\n• You apparently need the Razer Synapse software to change the RGB lighting, among other things.\n• That space bar much louder compared to all the other keys, and you most definitely will notice it. (Very loud for a membrane keyboard anyway.)\n• The keys are a bit tough to see without any lighting on, but not too bad. (I am just used to the Logitech K120 keyboard’s highly visible keys.)\n• The lack of dedicated media buttons, but I knew that before purchase.\n• The Synapse software is fascinating, yet quite slow. It’s still interesting to use, but not a positive in my book for a keyboard. (Try the Synapse Beta software instead, as it seemed more responsive.)\n\nMain review:\n\nI am coming from using a typical, no-frills, cheap keyboard called the Logitech K120 that is quite popular and I have had no issues with. I just wanted to try something…new.\n\nThis is my first gaming keyboard I tried since getting a Saitek Eclipse (series 1) with membrane keys back in 2008. I loved that Eclipse keyboard. I never had a gaming keyboard before that, and I just plugged the USB cable into my new desktop PC at the time and it worked. The Saitek Eclipse had dedicated/separate volume buttons and backlighting button on it other than using the function keys or something. The keys felt great and it never let me down for many years before I sold it for some reason. Also, I don’t recall needing to have downloaded some software unlike this Razer one to get the backlighting to work. No it didn’t have RGB lighting, but a keyboard with backlighting was amazing to me for a new desktop PC. Sure, this Razer keyboard works without downloading Razer’s Synapse software, but I wish there was a way to change the backlight color without it. That’s my main gripe about this Razer keyboard. I still haven’t tried the highly touted mechanical keyboards that I have been reading about for eons, but I have loved membrane keyboards so much that I haven’t felt the need to try mechanical yet. I may change my mind soon.\n\nThis keyboard evokes a bit of the same feeling as that keyboard, although this Razer keyboard of course doesn’t have dedicate media buttons. Do I need those dedicated media buttons? Not really…but they sure came in handy and I knew where they were and were easily accessible on the keyboard.\n\nSo, what I did after trying this Razer keyboard for a couple days is order a full-size Corsair K55 RGB gaming membrane keyboard with dedicated media buttons as well to see which one I respond to better.\n\nOverall, I think you will enjoy this gaming keyboard (for the price) if you have modest expectations and don’t require lots of features on many other more expensive gaming keyboards that I have read about before opting for this one.",

			"title": "Normal, Basic, keyboard but works with Razer Synapse",
			"body": "I know that some people are really picky about keyboards. When I started looking into getting a new one for myself, I saw lots of people talking about things like how raised they buttons are, how much noise they make, layout, etc. Personally even though I use my computer a lot, and I'm always typing, I don't care that much. My only preference is (and it is just a preference for me, not a deal breaker) is I like lower, non-raised keys which makes typing more comfortable and less strenuous on the fingers, though it's worth mentioning since this is a gaming keyboard, I don't think it really makes much difference when gaming.\n\nMy other preference, is I like a \"full\" keyboard layout. I don't care if the overall keyboard is big because it's a wired keyboard, so obviously it's for a stationary setup (if your not moving it around, why does size matter?) Also I like having the numpad, which I use quite a bit.\n\nAnyway, the whole reason I even decided to buy a new keyboard is I have gaming mouse that is also razer and I've really come to appreciate how cool having the ability to rebind and macro commands to different keys. My birthday came up, and I decided to get a cheap razer keyboard just so it would work with Razer Synapse.\n\nHonestly if your a keyboard connoisseur and you want to be able to control the RGB lights and have the keys make just the right amount of clicking sound or whatever, I'm sure you'll find something wrong with the keyboard and not like because it is pretty basic.\n\nIf you are like me however and are just looking for a slight upgrade or something that works with Razer Synapse, this is a great keyboard for a reasonable price!\n\nMy only complaint is by default the RGB lights are pretty bright, it's kinda jarring at night, even if you are using your computer with a nearby light to keep the room from being dark (which you should be doing if your looking at screen, it's better for your eyes). Also color of the light cycles on its own, which I don't really like. I don't even really care about RGB lights other than just allowing me to see the keys in the dark, so I'd rather they just stay one color. I don't care that much about it to take off a star though, and I've heard there are ways to adjust this either with third party software, or through something provided by Razer.",

For whatever reason, I actually prefer the feel of these to the several mechanical keyboards I've tried, and I've been using Razer for so long that the spacing is perfect for me. With both the original Ornata and Ornata v2, the only reason I upgraded was thinking the new one would be better despite loving the one I had.\n\nThe v3 is legitimately terrible. I have now had the plastic connectors break off from seven keys in less than 6 months. I have never had this happen with an Ornata before. The n-key rollover is significantly less than past models as well, meaning it won't register more than a few simultaneous key presses. I know this is a budget keyboard, but the Ornatas always have been and I've never had any issue with quality. If you're looking to spend this little on a keyboard, I'd definitely recommend going with something else. Maybe I've just been lucky with Razer products over the past decade, but this is the first quality issue I've seen and a quick search made it clear that this is a very common issue for the v3.",

It also is magnetic and snaps right up to this board when aligned right.\n\nLikes:\nHave always liked chiclet or half concave caps like these. Still like the quasi-membrane feel to these keys (listed as mechanical-membrane keys in technicals). RGB is brighter than generations past, so set your color right or be amazed at the color and not at your gameplay. The addition of the media keys at upper right corner was a nice touch.\n\nSuggestions for Razer:\nFor the love of god, get suggestions from the broader audience first before doing something you think is \"nice\" but not \"practical\", especially related to the wrist/palm wrest.",
