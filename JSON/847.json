      "title": "We really like Rover, our oversized tablet!",
      "body": "I was hoping this would turn into a decent purchase, and I have not been disappointed at all. In fact, I'd have to get picky to really find any big faults.\n\nIt really is basically a giant tablet. I have all my main apps on this that I have on my phone. It logged into my wifi easy, I have my Peacock, Paramount, Disney, Netflix, and other streaming apps and they work great. We have watched YouTube videos as it's so much bigger than watching on a phone. The system operation is also familiar as it's the same as my other Android devices. If you're android, you'll get it easily. If you're an apple, then it may take some adjustment as you'd expect.\n\nWe used this all day yesterday for cooking our 4 Thanksgiving pies. Having our large recipe keeper app display each recipe in such a large size was amazing. We could read this across the kitchen! Like any tablet, you can easily change the font size. We could make it so big to read that I think my neighbors could probably read from across the street!\n\nYou can easily tilt it from vertical to horizontal with ease, it's very smooth. Also, the stand is really well made. Has a weighted base so it is very stable, doesn't feel like it'll tip over. It also has a built in slide at the stand so you can lift or lower the screen several inches. It's weighted too, so this lifts/lowers very smooth and easy!\n\nThe volume I think is quite fine. We crank up music videos and it's volume is as good or better than I'd expect. It does have an audio out on it, so I am going to try to plug in a computer amp/speaker/sub package just for a little extra kick and base for the music videos (see edit 2 below!). But, I am not disappointed with the stock speakers, just more is better, right?!\n\nThe videos and quality appear to be as good as expected as well. Depending on the quality of the videos being played, we have seen some decent looking graphics from this. Considering we are sitting 2 feet away, I'm happy with it.\n\nThe one potential issue is the battery. We fully charged it and then didn't use for a week and it already was down to little battery. It charges fast and when plugged in, can be used indefinitely. Not plugged in, I'm not sure but guessing a couple hours? So, for our use, we will likely always pug it in. It's nice knowing we can set I out and use awhile on battery, but I don't think that will be the smartest primary use.\n\nThe initial assembly was pretty decent, instructions on the box were so so, but didn't take long to figure out. You do need to go to setting to Bluetooth sync the remote before you can use that. So do that right away. I also synced my phone and can screen share as well.\n\nThere is an on/off and volume button on back of the screen, but it's hard to find by feel only, would be nice if the buttons stuck out or had a texture. I always have to look back there to find.\n\nIn the end, we really like this and plan to get a lot of use out of it, mostly in the kitchen, but occasionally on the back patio too!\n\nEdit: We have found that simply letting this sit one week without using or being plugged in and the battery is basically dead. Not sure why there would be such a significant battery draw while sitting unused. This is my current only disappointment. That said, its usually always near an outlet, so when we want to use it, we plug it in and can use it that way and the battery then charges to full relatively quickly. Simply put, you can't let this sit several days and then expect to use on battery without needing to plug it in.\n\nEdit 2: Rover just got an upgrade! I just received my Logitech Z623 400 watt speaker system and YES, YES, YES! This works fantastic. (Everything you need comes in the box to direct hook right to the back of the 32\" display). The bass and sound is fantastic for this smallish speaker system! Now my music videos literally rock! I had it cranked and it was way to loud while I was sitting right in front of it. My family thought I had the house stereo cranked up! The Logitech has a push to turn on/off right on the right speaker, along with separate speaker volumn and bass volume controls. This just kicked Rover into a WHOLE new category!",

      "title": "Great alternative to LG Standbyme but bigger!",
      "body": "I was going to buy the LG to put it next to the kitchen/dining but 27” is really small to me considering my computer monitor is 49” lol. I was a little worried about this off-brand one and only time will tell for quality but it does exactly what the LG does for the same price but a little bigger at 32”. Easy to install, quality is only 1080p but LG is also only 1080p. I do notice 4K video looks better than regular 1080p. Remote is not great but I don’t think we’ll use it much for anything other than volume. It was more responsive than I expected given some reviews. Not extremely fast but not noticeably slow either. I like that it can go wireless and move around with me (perfect for bathroom trips lol). Sound is not great if you’re used to good speakers but for larger temporary entertainment vs a tablet when eating dinner or cooking and for those willing to pay for this vs a possible cheaper alternative with a nicer TV on a separate (but less aesthetic) stand, I think this does a good job. Hopefully it lasts a couple of years - we’ll see!",

But I use Canva presentation mode, scan QR code to attach phone as a remote and it works great.\nI realize maybe a lot of people are wanting this as a TV and I cannot speak to that use because I’m using it for presentations only. Sound isn’t great - don’t believe reviews you NEED external speakers if you want quality sound.\nI love the matte screen. You can see it even with bright windows - in my photo I’m literally facing a wall of bright windows and you can still see the screen. I bought a carrying case for the monitor so I can literally tighten 2 screws and have it on or off. The wheels roll great and it’s pretty sleek.",

I have to hard close the app multiple times and usually I can get it to finally work but it’s not simple or quick. The screen quality is just ok. Not great. The remote is difficult to use. The arrows don’t move easily, you have to hold them down while they slowly move to the desired position. Overall it’s not a great tv experience. But if you need it for a sign or something more basic it’s ok. Also you can’t pick it up without the stand disconnecting from the pole that holds the tv. Which makes it really difficult to move up steps or over any time of flooring connectors between rooms. They could’ve done better.",

For all the difficulty it was to put together, my hubby said it was the best gift I've ever given him. The picture quality is great. The ability to roll it around is amazing. We have watched movies down by our lake, out in the outdoor kitchen, and even in the garage. He even took it to hunting camp. The possibilities are endless with it.",

      "title": "Fun For The Whole Family!",
      "body": "I was going to buy the LG Stanbyme portable TV for my family as a holiday gift but I had concerns about the operating system and lack of apps. When I saw this on Amazon and noticed it was running Android 12 and had full Google Play store access I went with this instead. I also liked that the screen is an LG panel and is larger with 32 inches. Its only 1080p but video playback is really good. The colors and pictures are realistic and crisp. When it arrived, the box was pretty big and it was very heavy. Opening it all up was fairly easy and assembling the stand and connecting the screen took about 30 min. You do need to connect the screen cable in a couple of places but not a problem for me. Once setup and turned on you go through the usual android setup and login. There is plenty to like with this device, but a few shortcomings too. My family absolutely love this and it is moved from room to room everyday. It sits next to the dining table so everyone can watch while eating, my daughters use it for TikTok and YouTube, and we also use it for family game night and play games like monopoly on it which is actually great on a huge touchscreen. We also use it as a music center and have our Nest speakers connected and then use Spotify. It's great to see what music is playing. My wife loves to have it in the kitchen to follow recipes and she'll also catchup on her favorite TV shows. It's a versatile gadget for sure. Specs wise this is surprisingly impressive with 128gb onboard storage and 8gb Ram. The touchscreen is quick and repsonsive despite its size. The built in battery is a great benefit but we do find that it only lasts a couple of hours between charges. I also do not like the overlay this company has created for Android and wish they just had stock Android. My only other gripe is that the on/off button and volume rocker do not have a raised profile and it's quite hard to find by feel on the back of the device. That said there is an included remote control which looks a lot like a Samsung TV remote. It works well but there are some apps it's not compatible with. I'm glad I found this and so is my family.",
