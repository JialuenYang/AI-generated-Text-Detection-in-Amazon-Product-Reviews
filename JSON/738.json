Also, when I received the cases and opened them, the bottles were wet, as if some of the water had leaked out.

It’s good water but I feel that the pricing is just straight up corporate greed by the company. It’s not related to Amazon price mark ups in anyway. So I no longer recommend this water I recommend the Kroger brand that is the equivalent to this for just about $5 for 24 bottles or another retailer brand equivalent. This is just water. Fuel prices have come down, there’s no major water shortage in areas it comes from Wytheville Virginia. There’s no worker shortage. Maybe the terrible pricing issue is because it’s company based in California where they have constant water problems. But this shouldn’t affect water coming from and being bottled in Virginia.",

			"body": "I had ordered a webcam set-up (with four small boxes) from a company as a single purchase, and another order I had made for some bottled water. The products were great and I will not give the sellers a bad review. Everything was as expected and ordered and I have zero complaints regarding the product or the seller.\n\nAmazon fulfillment, however, boxed my order of sensitive equipment with bottled water. Like, I have no idea who this person was, but the outcome could have been horrible. Luckily, when the order arrived, and I hooked everything up, it all seemed to work fine. Amazon fulfillment fail - note to fulfillment: do not package sensitive electronics with bottled water in the same box. This could have ended so very, very badly.",
