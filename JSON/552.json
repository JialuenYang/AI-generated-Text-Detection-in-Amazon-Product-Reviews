The colors are true to the university’s official palette, and the graphic has remained intact even after several washes, showing no signs of fading or peeling.\n\nThe shirt is made from a soft and comfortable material, perfect for wearing all day, whether I’m attending classes, cheering at a game, or just lounging around. It breathes well during warmer days and has kept its shape and softness wash after wash.",
