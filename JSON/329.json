			"body": "They're good to great earbuds, I prefer the earbud style over in-ear nowadays, and I haven't found a better option for that than these. The sound quality is good, I like that they have a built-in remote, but they fail pretty often, usually within a few months. Usually what will happen is one side will start to decrease in volume until it's not working at all. Other earphones I've had have failed as well, and usually one side will just stop suddenly stop working, with the other one soon to follow, so I appreciate that these at least have a \"gentler\" decline, but it's still frustrating..",

Personally I got silicone covers for them to help at first cause they made my ears sore which may have been me just not knowing how to sit them in my ear properly, but after about a month of use, I was able to take the covers off and use them with no problem at all!\n\n0/10 Noise canceling,\nAbsolutely none, You can hear a pen drop but what can you expect from 15$ earbuds, You get better Audio quality then most 200+ dollar earbuds.\n\n8/10 Audio,\nThe Audio on these bad boys is beyond the 15$ Value, comparible to the modern day Airpods or Samsung buds, You get some serious bass and well balanced on all other frequencies.\n\n10/10 Microphone,\nLast but definitely not least the Microphone. You'll see these earbuds all over YouTube & Tiktok, after buying them and testing the mic out I totally understand why! This thing has some CLARITY.\n\nOverall a 10/10, Can't beat the Audio or Mic for this price!\n\n(Also packaging has a premium feel to it and is very satisfying to open if that matters to you)",

The sound quality is fabulous and the whatever thing is placed right near my mouth, so no more holding the cord up so people could hear me better. The cord is also long enough that I don't have to constantly hold it in my hand. I can slip it into my pocket with ease and keep talking or listening. I can even put it down and have plenty of space to maneuver, like when chatting with a friend while doing the dishes. Someone mentioned that they'll wear out within a year. I don't care. Look at the price! I'll buy a new pair if that turns out to be true. Again, the quality is just great. Go for it!",
