			"body": "With all the Magsafe/Qi 2 car mounts out there, I was looking for the best one. I decided to try this one and am very happy with my purchase.\n\nA lot of them are very similar, but the reason I went with this one is that there's no stupid logo or text staring at you in the face whenever you go to use it.\n\nThat said, this does everything very well too. The magnets are strong, and sometimes I even have to pull with a decent amount of force to break the magnetism. The phone is definitely going nowhere when you're driving. I'm sure it'll even hold a tablet no problem if you really want to attach one. It should be noted that I have a case on my phone with embedded magnets in it to Magsafe/Qi 2 specs. If you have a case without it, the magnetism will be weaker since it will have more material to go through. If this is a problem though or the phone itself does not have this spec, this mount does include a magnetic ring to attach to the outside or directly to the phone.\n\nThe plate attachment to your car using adhesive is rock solid. The bond holds extremely well and when the day comes when I want to take the mount off my car, it will be an ordeal. The 3M VHB adhesive that they use I've seen and used on other mounts and I can tell you it will hold pretty much anything.\n\nI have not used the vent attachment since I will not be needing it. Also remember that if you are using any vent attachment that any time you use the heater be sure it is not blowing on your phone. The heat will kill performance, charge rate, and your battery.",

However, when I got the package I noticed their bent attachment.\n\nThe vent attachment IS. THE. WAY!!!\n\nThe vent attachment isn’t like any other one I have seen before. All the others simply slide on to a vent and then fall off. This one RATCHETS onto the vent and it stays there!\n\nPLUS, the magnets are super strong. I have an iPhone, so they’re very functional with the MagSafe case that I have already.

Unfortunately the shape and texture of my dashboard would not allow for mounting either. My dashboard has an area behind the infotainment screen that is not leather but the mount would be blocked by that screen which defeats the purpose.\n\nSo I gave this to my son who drives an older model Hyundai and he was able to mount it on his dashboard without issue. So keep in my that if you dashboard is soft and leather texture then this mount will not adhere to it. It was very straightforward to set up with the included directions. Very reasonable price as well. I can’t speak to longevity since he’s only used it for a week now but it does come with an additional dash mount.

The magnets are considerably stronger than the other brand - maybe as much as 2X stronger - but not too strong. I’ve used this with two different MagSafe cases (steel ring built into case) and I have had no issues with either phone (iPhone 14 & 14 Pro) falling off the mount while I’m driving. The vent mount works well and is very secure with a relatively small mounting footprint. The only issue I have had was when trying to mount this to my 2011 Toyota Tundra vent. The vent fins in that vehicle have very little depth and the tightening mechanism bottomed out before tightly clamp onto the vent fin. It was a simple fix to take the mount apart and shorten the thread side of the hook in order to increase the clamping travel of the hook. It took 5 minutes to make this modification. Overall, I feel I made the right choice buying this brand and have put it in two of my vehicles.",

I did not expect to like this product, compared to some of the pretty ones made from high quality metal but when I installed this one in my AC vent, it worked better than all the others.\n\nThe two most important reasons that I stuck with this product is that the vent installation positioned my phone a closer to me than the dashboard mount options which were nearly a foot farther away. The closer installation makes my phone easier to see and safer to access from the driver seat.\n\nThe other stand-out aspect of this product is that the vent mount is very secure and transfers a minimal amount of vibration to the phone. The dash mounted car mounts that I tested all vibrated constantly due to the soft mounting adhesives and too much play in the mechanical parts of the mounts.\n\nI was surprised that I liked this device better than the others since is is nearly all plastic and has a less pleasing of an appearance but, as I said above, is just works better.

			"body": "So I bought this on a whim. It was $10. I figured why not. I have a 2020 Mazda cx-30 preferred and finding a spot for the phone is a bit tricky. You can buy those $100+ pro mounts but even those go in between your dash and I just don't dig that idea so much.not to mention it'll stick up above the dash by a huge margin. Doesn't look great and too far away. Don't want to mess with the dash and the leather either. So I bought this for the vent mount. Not using a cup mount. I need my cupholders.\n\nRight out of the box I was pleasantly surprised. The weight was nice and solid. Powder coated and steel. Hardened plastic knobs. The pieces were all there, wrapped nicely. I refuse to use a wallet so I have one of those card cases. Of course with a bunch of cards between the phone and magnet nothing sticks. So I attached this metal ring that came with this kit onto the back of my card case. 3m it says. Went on easily has stayed there nicely for a few weeks. No peeling or moving.\n\nThe unit itself attached right to the vent. The way the vent slats are tapered I had to attach it upside down but that's not a big deal. You can cinch it up nice and tight. You attach the phone to the mount right side up so no biggie. I've been using it for about two weeks and I actually love it.\nMy only complaint is the space is a little tight near my windshield wiper lever but that's not the mounts issue. Thats a car design issue.\n\nHighly recommend. Would buy for double the price. Great value. Excellent quality.",

I can easily take it on and off and place it on any other vents in my car. For reference I have a Mazda CX9. Going to get one for my mother and partner since they always complain that their phone falls of the magnetic clip. So far so good.",

And it's nice and easy to move the angle of the mount around.\n\nThe only slight downside I would say is it's pretty big and your phone sticks out more from the dashboard than my old one.. which could be a pro or con depending on your needs. I had to reposition it further away from my steering column and light signal because I kept bumping into them when trying to access the phone.

I liked the base and the adhesive was both high quality and branded - two definite plusses in my book. The vent clip seemed fine as well despite not being why I bought the item.\n\nThe problem came from the magnetic component. While the magnets worked, the coupling component is one piece of plastic while the magnetic portion is a different, hard piece of plastic with the two married together via a small screw. It seems at some point, the pieces broke apart. However, the tight fit of the two pieces didn't show it right away.\n\nAt the moment, I figure given the price, it's not worth dealing with the hassle of replacement and I don't feel like returning the whole thing since half of it is already stuck to the dashboard of my car. Glue to the rescue? Right now, I'm attempting to glue the pieces together and try to make it work. Eventually I'll find the right formula that will do the job - likely crazy glue is in my future.\n\nOverall, I can't give this a bad review. I'm disappointed surely, but the product seems functional and it is what I wanted - though not broken would have been a plus. I chalk my experience up to shipping or some other factor involved.
