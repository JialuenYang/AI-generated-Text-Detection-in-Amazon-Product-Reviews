      "body": "I recently bought this childproof door lever lock, and it's been fantastic for keeping my toddler safe at home. Installation was a breeze, and the lock works perfectly. No drills or screws needed, which is a huge plus. The adhesive stays strong, and it's easy for adults to use while keeping kids from opening doors. It's brought me peace of mind knowing my child can't wander or open doors without permission. I've recommended it to many friends and family members, and they've all been impressed. This lock truly takes away the worry of child safety at home.",
