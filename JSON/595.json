The transition between modes is smooth, and being able to take the fun with you anywhere is just great.\n\nAs for the bundle itself, choosing a Mario game is an excellent idea. Being able to choose between iconic titles like \"Super Mario Odyssey\", \"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\" or \"Super Mario Party\" allows you to personalize the experience according to your preferences. All of these games are gems in themselves, and each one offers endless hours of entertainment.\n\nThe build quality of the console and Joy-Con is solid, and the Mario-themed design adds a special touch. The controls are precise, and the ease with which the Joy-Con can be shared to play with friends makes gaming sessions even more fun.\n\nThe Switch's screen is bright and vibrant, bringing Mario's worlds to life with rich colors and sharp details. The smoothness of the games is impressive, and I did not experience any lag or performance issues during my gaming sessions.",
