      "body": "We have lived in my house for over 10 years. It‚Äôs an older house built in the 60s, There are 6 of us in the house 4 adults, one 13y and one 7y. We have 3 ring devices, 4 Alexa‚Äôs, 6 fire sticks, 6 computers, 6 gaming consoles, a generator, and we all have iPads, cell phones etc, so there are a lot of devices connected to our wifi, so we‚Äôve never had great luck with the range or performance of our internet signal. Things would buffer alot or we‚Äôd have dropped signals, so I was always restarting the router. We use to have Brighthouse but currently have Spectrum with just internet, We upgraded our internet to 1GB over a year ago and was given a dual band wifi 5 router that never really worked for us perfectly, I believe it was because it couldn‚Äôt support 1GB, but didn‚Äôt know that until I got this router. We were using an extender so we could connect to our generator and ring camera that was located outside, and just so you can have an idea, on our generator the wifi signal was at 2%, which was fine but if we wanted to connect anything else outside it was almost impossible. So we contacted customer support about the issues we were having, and they sent us there newest router the wifi 6e router, mind you we were still using the extender. It worked good for a couple days then it stopped. A lot of buffering and a lot of devices wouldn‚Äôt even connect to it like my Oculus Quest 2, my husbands work computer and more! I couldn‚Äôt even connect our ring camera outback, and the generator outside was getting 0%-1% signal, so the signal would drop a lot. I figured it was because a lot of things still aren‚Äôt compatible with wifi 6. So we called support again they did manage to get everything working for about 5 days, then it would stop again. So we called support for the last time and they told us to try to buy a router ourselves. So I happened to come across this one. I was pretty skeptical, thinking it may work as well as the dual band one we had only maybe a little better. The setup process was so easy! Didn‚Äôt have to call Spectrum at all! I do wish that the parental controls, security+ and, QoS was free. But they do give you a free month with any of them. So I did the security+. The app you use with it is great! There are a lot of tools in the settings. You can have it auto connect to a network or set it up separately so you can choose 2.4, 5 or 6G, which is what I did. You can have a guest network, optimize your network performance and a lot more! Everything connected perfectly with excellent signal! So I figured I would try to connect the generator and ring camera outback without the extender just for kicks, since I was feeling optimisticüòé The ring camera connected perfectly with excellent signal! Now was the most important test, the generatorüòµ‚Äçüí´ Connected it for the first time and I see 22% signal!!! I was SOOO excited! Then I went to the farthest part of my backyard with my cell phone where Iv never had wifi signal before and I had 3-4 bars of wifi signal!!! I couldn‚Äôt believe it! This thing has GREAT range, GREAT performance, and is easy to set up and use, what else could you want! It‚Äôs been a couple weeks now, no buffering! and everything works flawlessly! I couldn‚Äôt be happier! No one complaining for me to fix the wifi anymore and no restarting it twice a week! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has horrible or just ok wifi signal. The only flaw I can say about it is needing a subscription for the extras. Otherwise just go for it! You don‚Äôt like it just return it.",

He did a web-based install vs using the app at her request (one less app on her phone), but I would have used the app method as it's pretty straight forward. It updated in about five minutes or less. With its six antennas it's not much to look at and each has a plastic rapper, which are a nuisance to remove.\n\nThis is the WiFi 6e model, so make sure you are not buying the WiFi 6 model when you purchase. It was on sale for $159 (usually $199) so good value and works well in her 1900sf house. This comes with a built-in modem so she eliminated the cable company's unit and will save $6/mo. WiFi 7 is out there, but expensive and this should work well for a few years. This may work well in a larger home, but I prefer a mesh router system for my larger house and property, especially when I'm outside using my phone. Netgear is a reliable company with a reputation for good service. If you can find it on sale, I would buy it. Good luck!",

      "body": "Good:\n2.5gbe, 10gbe, fiber connections allow you to use the full potential of your internet provider and your network almost(10gbe is more like 6gbe but I don't have enough devices to absolutely need 10gbe)\nWifi coverage is absolutely outstanding out of the box and even better when you tweak a few channel widths and channels in the very simple (for me) setup. I can cover a dull 2500sqft home with full high speed wifi with a single device. Not even my Asus Rapture ax11000 could come close. In the main areas where the router is located most wifi devices connect up to 1.4G. I can pull 800mbs from the back deck 900 on the front porch, 1g in a far bathroom and 500mbs in the farthest room/corner of the house.\nConnected Clients. This is where the Axe300 shines. I've tried several routers and setups to easily alleviate my main issue with most home routers and mesh. Regardless of what anyone says, most routers start to act up to almost shut down once you get in the 40 device range. I have a very connected home and since I lease I can't go running ethenet drops everywhere and don't care to invest in a mocca and think even the best powerline adapters are not the greatest. I currently have 63 IOT type wifi 2.4 devices on my network, 8 sonos speakers in a mixed ethernet/wifi setup, multiple IP cams, 2 wifi door locks, a wifi doorbell, 4 phones on wifi, 2 3k tvs on wifi, 2 4k tvs on ethernet,1 ps5 on wifi, 1 ps5 on ethernet, a Nas on 10g ethernet, up to 3 macbook pros on ethernet, sometimes an android tablet or two on wifi and I can still pull the numbers listed above when I try to stress everything I can and run and control everything I can. This router just keeps chugging. 2.4 wifi is the best I have had since the old days of great 2.4 only aps/routers, openwrt, ddwrt, boosted signal strength, etc. Even with all the IOT devices I have never seen less than a 65mbs connection to one of them or not been able to pull 60 to 70mbs down from my 2.4 wifi iot/guest band and maintain the FULL upload of my provider (super drops in upload with lots of WIFI iot is usually rhe first sign of your router not being able to handle the connections, then usually ping next and then jitter..)\nBad:\nTo me it's ugly. Like I stepped on a spider and it's dead upside down. Ymmv. It's clunky, definitely not pretty or sleek.\nWeb interface just works but I'm a DD-WRT, tomato, openwrt, unifi, managed poe switch kind of guy and miss some of the customizations/features even the Omada or even dare I say an Asus router sometimes gives you.\nTo me the tether app sucks. It works perfectly but you cannot see connected device connection speeds, rssi or even the rudimentary cpu utilization and ram usage you can with the web app.\nWould be nice is you could \"properly\" use smart connect for all 4 radios. You can work around this though easily.\nThere are a lot of mesh devices (I won't even need any of them) that are not compatable yet with their mesh system.\nAll those are little nags. The only thing I really do not like about this router is no SQM support for buffer bloat. I don't have buffer bloat issues but without more detailed controls on the router settings and/or SQM some customers may not see the full potential a router of this capability/cost can do.\n\nOverall for all in one router/ap for lots amd lots of connected devices plus full access to 10gbe, 2.4gbe, your over 1g provider connection I do not think you can find a better one. Even the new BE routers that are wifi 7 from TPLINK (they were the first to make them) have less 2.4 wifi capability and until something totally changes with cheap wifi IOT, 2.4 wifi is going to be where it is at foe the interim.",

      "title": "Day 1 - excellent router so far. Will update.",
      "body": "Upgraded from the Archer C3150 V1 (which was an upgrade from another TP Link router before that). Excellent upgrade. Set it up yesterday in about 3 min. I am an IT Professional for a living, so yes, my opinion on what's \"simple\" might not be the same as others. But that said, I imagine the interface was so simple anyone could set it up in less than 10 min. It walks you through everything. My 3 min included custom settings and port forwards, virtual servers, VPN, the works lol. Simple setup is great for beginners but if you're looking for more advanced features like these just click advanced and go to town.\n\nMy old C3150 did a solid job for 4 years, but recently started having issues. The 5Ghz would almost never work, and the router needed rebooted once a day ish. I don't hold this against TP Link tho, because I have had Netgear, Asus, Lynksys, TP Link, you name it, I've worked with it either at home or at work, trust me, they ALL go bad eventually. From my experience, TP Link has the smoothest firmware, the longest life (4-8 years for me so far), and most reliable connection. The main reason I started with TP Link at home 12 years ago was because it was the only brand that gave me the FULL speed that my ISP was sending me. I pay for 1 Gig, and on a TP Link, I get 1 Gig.\n\nAnyways, signal around the house is significantly stronger with this than with my old Archer C3150. Ranch style house, router is on far end (worst spot ever, but best I could do). Old router would only get the 2.4 G to other side of house, with about 10Mbps on my phone. This one blasts all three bands strongly all the way out the other end of the house lol. 400Mbps on my phone standing right by the router (Samsung Note 20, non-ultra), and 150Mbps when I'm aaaaall the way on the other end of the house in the bedroom with the door shut. 100Mbps out the garage and on the sidewalk. House is ranch just under 2000 square feet. So distance/wall wise it's about the same as a 3500 sq ft 3 level house. This thing will do just fine in any average house. My basement is not counted in that sq ft and still gets perfect signal.\n\nGood thing about this router is is works with TP Link mesh ad ons, so if I ever decide I need an extender I can get one later. Pretty sure I won't tho.\n\nAll in all, great start to a hopefully long 5 or 6 years with this router. Again, I only got it yesterday. If anything changes I promise to update this review right away.",

      "body": "11/19/22: So, I want to update my review. This router did NOT die so quickly. It turns out it was an issue in the area with my ISP. The second router had the exact same issue, so I knew it could not be the router at that point. This has been performing flawlessly since. I see no reason to return either of them, as I can use the second one for a separate network for some of my wired IoT devices.\n\nThe router itself has a slightly bigger profile than I have been using for the past 3 years, but the antenna array allows for signal shaping that helps alleviate a couple of dead zones. Setup was quick and easy and we were online in minutes. The option to name each network individually is really nice. You don't have to have the \"_5G\" or \"_6G\" words appended to the end of your network name for each band. I have not tried the parental controls as I have no need for them.\n\nThe USB port is nice for using a tiny flashdrive to move and back up files and photos from our phones wirelessly and access them on our computers without using one of the many cloud subscriptions out there.\n\nAll in all, this is a great little starter router if you are looking to use the new 6e band on compatible devices and keep legacy networks for your older ones. As of this writing, we have screaming fast wifi as we are the only 6e network in range of our home. We've pulled 900+ Mbps speed tests on our gigabit line using the 6e band.\n\nI left the original review below:\n\nThis router is a great value to get your network on the new 6e standard. It performs well with a gigabit connection. Set-up was simple and straightforward, but the wireless functions started failing after just one month.\n\nI had to buy a new one to get my network back up and running since I am outside the exchange window now.",

      "title": "Fantastic speeds for a competitive price!",
      "body": "I upgraded my Internet speed in spring 2020, in the early part of the pandemic to 1GB to keep up with 4 laptops, 1 desktop, a Ring camera with chime, a Ring security system, two Roku sticks on smart TVs, 1 Ubiquity WAP, and two NES Switches (among other Wi-Fi devices), TV streaming, and online PC gaming. As our Internet-home grew, the devices with Wi-Fi connected devices exceeded 20. With the upgrade, I had to replace my coaxial router/modem to a permanently installed Frontier modem and an Arris NVG468MQ router that could take a WAN Ethernet port. The Frontier-provided Arris router was not new, low range, and buggy. I went through 3 of these Arris routers in 2.5 years with full Wi-Fi bars but with exactly the same errors (\"Connected, no internet\", \"No Internet, secured\", etc.). Nearly pulled my hair. The family was not happy either. Although the Arris router is compatible with 1GB Ethernet upgraded speeds, it appears to cap at about 600 MB. Believe me, I NEVER, ever, got close to 600 MB with Arris. At an OK speed check I would get 30-60 MB Wi-Fi speeds and sometimes crack 100 MB on my Wi-Fi connected laptops, and maybe a bit higher on my Ethernet-connected desktop. On my Samsung S20 phone I would get 80-120MB speeds.\n\nWhen the Frontier tech visited to check my Internet problems on the second Arris router, I gave him the list of errors (4 in total, two that I named here) and right away he said it was the router and just gave me another one (the 3rd one at that point). Since I had him at home, I asked him if I could buy a router from Best Buy or Amazon and just \"plug it in?\". He said, \"Yes, your Internet setup is plug-n-play, just make sure the router has a blue or red Ethernet port.\" With that information I started some light research figuring I had maybe a year before the \"new\" Arris router would get buggy again. Well, it took about a month and I started getting the same exact errors as the previous Arris routers I had replaced. Although the Arris router \"corrected\" itself a few days later, I was done with Arris routers from Frontier. I sped up my research urgency for a new router from better known brands. At this point I felt I had control over the brand and price point I could buy knowing that I only needed a router and not a modem since Frontier installed a permanent modem when they upgraded my Internet to 1GB speed.\n\nHaving read about 6E enabled routers--catching up on the newest router/Wi-Fi standards--I figured that a 6E router would be the best option for me as a \"future-proof\" investment. I narrowed the search to TP-Link, Netgear Nighthawk, and Asus models. This TP-Link AXE5400 beat all the other brands in price for roughly similar, or at least comparable, reviews, features, and range. I purchased this TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band WiFi 6E Router (Archer AXE75). TP-Link AXE5400 had excellent reviews on Amazon but also across the Internet from reputable technology websites and sources. I did not rely only on Amazon reviews given the issues with bogus reviews. The \"plug-n-play\" setup at my home with a Frontier 1GB speed was just that easy. Within about 2 minutes of connecting the TP-Link AXE5400 router, all the lights came \"on\". I rushed to my Ethernet-plugged desktop and opened my browser. Right away I saw the TP-Link landing page asking for an admin login and password setup, and an Admin account. Several steps later, I reused the previously used SSID and password credentials to minimize connectivity disruptions on all my Wi-Fi-enabled devices and in a flash I was connected to the Internet. I might have spent maybe 20 minutes total, from unboxing to setup to Internet, with some thought-provoking time needed to come up with a new login and password for my TP-Link account.\n\nMy desktop Ethernet-connected speed test blew me away: I broke the 700/800MB download/upload speeds! I ran a speed test on my Samsung S20 but got the 100+ MB speed that I had gotten with the Arris router. I wondered if it would make a difference if I \"forgot\" the SSID on the phone and then log back in to the same SSID and password? Sure did! After I \"forgot\" the SSID on my phone and logged back in and ran a speed test, I broke the 800 MB download speed on the phone. Fantastic! My laptop speeds exceeded the 200 MB download/upload speed marks. Another laptop hit the 190/200 MB download/upload speed marks.\n\nAlthough I am kinda rushing with this review, I feel I made the right purchase and that this TP-Link AXE5400 will outlast the last 3 Arris routers that this router replaced. I will return to review in a few months with good or bad impressions at that time. But, right now, I am a happy dad with a happy family.",

      "body": "As noted in at least one other review, the TP-Link AXE16000/Archer AXE300 is ideal for a Frontier FiOS customer. It‚Äôs the router Frontier supplies with the FiOS 5 Gig service; but, if you have ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2 Gig, you get the eero Pro 6E, which isn‚Äôt nearly as satisfactory ‚Äî especially if you want a full-speed wired connection to a computer with 10 Gb Ethernet, because the eero has only a single 1 Gb Ethernet output.\n\nFrontier‚Äôs 5 Gig service, even if it were available to my house, would be an extra $50-or-so/month; and, truly, 2 Gig is more than enough for my needs both now and for some time to come. To put it another way: in 10 months, the savings pay for the router, which I then get to own rather than renting. (In fact, perhaps this is **why** the 5 Gig service costs $50/month more, since 2 Gig and 5 Gig use the exact same ONT and switching from 2 Gig to 5 Gig requires only a router change from the eero to the TP-Link.) In the meantime, having the TP-Link router lets me make fuller use, today, of what‚Äôs already coming down the fiber with the 2 Gig service. Also, the TP-Link software provides **far** more control over my network than the purposefully limited eero software.\n\nWith the TP-Link, all my WiFi devices are getting substantially higher down/up performance than what the FiOS-supplied eero was able to supply; and, man, is it ever nice to give my computer a full-speed wired connection again!\n\nThe only initial hiccup I experienced with the TP-Link router was getting it to accept a firmware update, either from the TP-Link server or from a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù download. However, a cold reboot and reset solved the problem.\n\nIncidentally, in case you saw one particular YouTube video where the guy smugly ragged on the TP-Link (even though many of his complaints were related to his own home‚Äôs lower-end connectivity, for which a router like this one is admittedly overkill): yes, the router is fairly warm to the touch, **but** so is the eero Pro 6E, even though it‚Äôs doing a lot less ‚Äúwork‚Äù! So don‚Äôt worry about that as long as you can put it in a place that‚Äôs decently ventilated.\n\nBottom line: if you have Frontier‚Äôs FiOS 2 Gig service, get this router. Period. No, it‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôll get you what you **thought** you were paying for with the 2 Gig service ‚Äî and then you‚Äôll own the thing rather than renting it. Moreover, it‚Äôll take care of you until WiFi 7 support is common across the majority of your devices, which could be quite a few years.",

Clearly, I was missing the boat on something because my old router, despite advertising 1Gbps was only delivering about 285Mbps download on Speedtest (75Mbps up). After I hooked up the new TP-LINK, got all my custom stuff setup, NAT, WiFi, etc. I ran another Speedtest measurement.\n\nHOLY COW!! 930Mbps download on the first run and over 110Mbps upload. I attached two pictures; first one is the speeds on my old Cisco/Linksys router, the 2nd is on the new TP-Link. NOTE: These are all hardwired systems (1Gb connections, so your WiFi speeds will vary).\n\nJust be sure to reset your defaults, new SSID, use good security, strong password, yada yada yada - you will enjoy this router. I think the total replacement time after reading the instructions was about 20-40 min from start to finish.\n\nI did install the TP-Link app on my phone and setup an account first. But I used the default WiFi info included with the router to do that setup. I'm sure either way works fine. Once the router was connected and my info was input, the TP-Cloud app automatically updated on my phone to show the new router.",

After having it, I learned I don't have a computer or device that uses 6E but it is there for down the road, and I turned it off for now. Seems to be only the very latest smartphones that have it. BTW ‚Äì Apple iPhone 14 does not have 6E.\n\nThings I like:\n1. Able to go to the web page and configure without having to disconnect from the modem. Netgear Nighthawk would not let me configure it with it connected to the modem. However, it does add extra security.\n2. The tp-link mobile app has more features than Netgear and can see what devices are streaming. I love seeing the upload and downloads with live data. Very cool.\n3. Love the parental monitor software that comes with it‚Äîstill deciding if I should subscribe.\n4. Some of my devices on my network with the Netgear and older router would kick a couple of devices off the network. This seems to be solid and had no issue so far.\n\nThe thing I dislike:\n1. Hard to identify the clients in the mobile app and web page configuration. I have 31 clients on my network. Had to manually go to each device and figure out it MAC address or IP address of the client. Once I knew I could name it. Apple devices are very difficult to figure out. MAC addresses did not match the client's MAC address in App. I had to stream YouTube and then identify it by its download data indication in the app to confirm. Some were also figured out by the process of elimination. The Netgear App does say it is an Apple device on the client page, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs unknown in the tp-link app.\n\nOverall a great router and glad I purchased it.\n\nUpdate: 1/19/24\nThey have made several updates to Tether Router App and love it. TP-Link continues to improve its products. Seems to recognize Apple devices now. However, if you go to your router settings in the browser you will find if you Whitelist the Apple product does not connect for very long. The reason is Apple added security feature to change MAC address from time to time. In this case, the router does not compensate for this and you have to turn off the Private Wi-FI Address in the Apple devices app under Wi-Fi and Network setting for that Wi-Fi network. Kind of a bummer until they fix it if they can fix it. Wi-Fi tech is constantly changing. Apple is hoping to get Wi-FI 6e working on iPhone 15 Pro soon. It currently does work if your SSID matches for both 5G and 6e networks. Mine is not and therefore have to wait. Bummer.",

      "body": "I have worked in IT for 30 years and have typically purchased Linksys products. I bought some Netgear routers in the past as well. Linksys used to give me the ability to support CIDR, or define my network as I wish. For example, I could define my internal network as 10.10.10.0/22, giving me a usable host IP range from 10.10.8.1 through 10.10.11.254 (network 10.10.8.0 with a broadcast address of 10.10.11.255). That means I can give my router an IP address of 10.10.9.0 as a valid IP address if I choose. Linksys did away with that ability, but TP Link still allows it. I hate being tied to 192.168.1.1, as Verizon, Comcast, RCN and other internet providers ultimately are still stuck with those standards, and when you plug in your own router, you may immediately be stuck with an IP conflict.\n\nMy first TP Link router was the AX11000. That router was not impressive for any reason. Still, I purchased the AXE16000 for its Wifi 6E capabilities. Where the AX11000 struggles to cover my 2400 square foot home, the AXE16000 covers not only the home but the back yard as well. It is feature-rich and gives you the flexibility to define multiple channels, channel width, OFDMA and MU-MIMO support. If you don't know what any of those things are, then save your money and buy something cheaper. The guest network is really cool - when you have guests over, give them a password and when they connect they can be sent to a specific web page of your choosing. I think that's geeky cool.\n\nThis isn't a small router - and it runs hot. In my house I have about 35 - 40 connected devices. I have my appliances, TV set top boxes (wifi), refrigerator, Alexa, Firecubes, Apple TV's, etc. on a dedicated IoT network, and my Apple/Windows/IOS/Android devices on the 2.4/5/6GHz bands. I have Verizon FIOS 1Gbps internet and have run multiple speed tests simultaneously and the CPU, memory and throughput on the AXE16000 never falter.\n\nFor $500 I think it's worth it, at least until Wifi 7 comes out.",

      "body": "I have a month's experience with the AXE5400 Tri-Band Router (also known as AXE75). And I've found it's performance great. I live in an apartment building with about 18 units - and the 6 GHz signal offers the bandwidth I need. I find that we are the only family (apt) on the 6 GHz signal. I expect that to change. But there is enough room for everyone to have their own channel, so it won't be a problem.\n\nAs you compare the other routers against this one, be aware that many of them say they're Tri-Band Routers, but in the fine print, say that the bands are 2.4, 5, and 5 GHz. That's ok for creating a back-haul link, but it's not good for getting the benefits of the 6 GHz band. Those benefits are extra channels. And it's unlikely you'll be in competition with the other families in your neighborhood.\n\nMy one criticism of TP-Link's AXE 5400 router is that they tend to emphasize performance. I'd rather the offer an ability to personalize the router for a single family home vs apartment complex. The configuration out-of-the-box is for a single family home. However, that's not my situation. Ours is an apartment building with about 18 competing familes.\n\nThis raises another benefit of the software in TP-Link's AXE 5400. With a little effort, the 5 GHz band has an extra feature on it called DFS, and it applies channels 52 through 144 (skipping 4 each time). These are channels allocated to things like Radar and Weather Radar. My understanding is that when you allocate a DFS channel, it listens for a minute or so, and if it hears a Radar signal it bails and allocates one of the non-DFS channels. But for me, it works. I won't say which works, you'll need to experiment yourself.\n\nAs you experiment with the router, you'll find it beneficial to drop the bandwidth from 160 to a more modest 80. That will make it less likely you'll find a radar signal in your suggested channel. I'd also reduce the signal protocol from a/n/ac/ax to a/n/ac as well. And you might choose to do something similar with the 2.4 GHz signal.\n\nIn conclusion, I find that AXE5400 an excellent router. As I have described above, my laptop and phone are able to use the 6 GHz band. And my devices that are on the 5 GHz band are able to use the DFS feature and enjoy a clear band with no interference from competing routers. Devices that are on the 2.4 GHz band (Roomba, Printer) are able to be connected to the network. All get along with each other well.",

      "body": "Intro and initial thought:\n\nI normally don‚Äôt do reviews on something I just bought, I like to wait until I‚Äôve put things to their intended use for a few months at least, unless something is wrong. Happy to say so far nothing is wrong, per say, with the Archer AXE300, ‚ÄúIF‚Äù you‚Äôve worked in IT/IS.\n\nThis is one of very few consumer routers on the market, right now, that offer 10gps speed and I personally do not think it was meant for the average consumer/gamer.\n\nThe Set up:\n\nThe setup here is two gaming PCs (self-built), a slew of smartphones, a few Alexa devices with assorted IOT light bulbs/wall sockets, an older Dell R710 server hosting a few online game servers for Rust.\n\nThe AXE300 replaced a Nighthawk R7000 (it‚Äôs Wi-Fi had started to drop connections too frequently in the last year or so) hooked up to an Arris BGW210-700 running AT&T Fiber 1Gig in bridge mode.\n\nThe AXE300 can be set up without using the TP-Link Cloud service or the phone app, with just the IP address of the router. I haven‚Äôt seen anything from their marketing that gives an advantage to using their service or app, since I cannot think of any good reason that I‚Äôd ever want to mess with my network while away from home.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nFollowing the TP Link set up instructions, one does get an internet connection, but just a basic one. If all you are doing is setting up and forget, this may work for you. However, other less costly routers are out there that will do the same.\n\nThe problem arises from the AT&T Arris modem. It sees the AXE300 and connects to it, however it does NOT pass on the Gateway IP to the router. This will cause all sorts of issues if you are port forwarding, especially if running a server to the outside world!\n\nThe Fix:\n\nOn the AT&T router go to \"Firewall\", then \"IP Passthrough\", then to \"Passthrough Fixed MAC Address\". Click the list and pick AXE300, this will auto fill the router‚Äôs MAC address. Rebooted router and all should work!\n\nNote: You will still need to redo all your port forwarding in the modem since they are tied to the MAC address of the router. Doing the above step does not update them to the new MAC address of the AXE300. So do NOT change the MAC Clone from ‚ÄúUse Default MAC Address‚Äù in the AXE300 settings!\n\nClosing:\n\nI hope this helps someone from spending 8 hours like I did from finding this fix.\n\nRight now, the AXE300 gets 5 stars for doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do, that may change in the future as I throw more at it‚Ä¶",

Again, a lot of the same issues that I thought every router would have. Thus, I had a routine of having to reboot the router several times a week. This was a huge problem because I have 177 devices on average connected to it (smart home). Then I would have to shut off every breaker in the house to hope everything would reconnect. There were always a few items that wouldn't connect again. The problem got worse and then I bought another RAXE500 (third one) as when you call Netgear they are useless, and they rarely send out firmware updates. Got the router and again, all was great for a few months... then it started again. This time you couldn't just reboot the router. When you rebooted it, it wouldn't connect to the internet. You had to do the opposite with it. Meaning you would have to reboot the router, then reboot the modem. Then cross your fingers that it worked. I would usually have to reboot the modem several times for the RAXE500 to accept the signal. The modem is not the problem - it's the Netgear RAXE500. Finally, I gave up and bought the TP Link AXE75 6E router. I was a little apprehensive because the TP Link didn't have gigabyte ability. Thus, I thought I was going to lose a lot of speed. With the Netgear (when performed from the Netgear app) I would have an average of 1,427 MBPS because it had the gigabyte ability. I had about 525 MBPS on my MacBook & iPhone. The TP Link does not have this function. I set up the TP Link and as soon as I had it set up I had average speeds on my MacBook Pro of 775, and about 774-815 on my iPhone 14 Pro. As well, within minutes of setting up the router (I used the old 2.4 & 5 GHZ SSD names and passwords) everything was connected - I mean every single device. I would never buy another Netgear router. I will stick with this cheap $170.00 TP LINK 6E router, and I will upgrade it when TP link comes out with a model with gigabyte ability. Oh ya, my house is a single-story house that is 3,214 Sq feet under air. The signal on the TP LINK is about 30% better than the Netgear. I no longer drop a single bar anywhere in my home. THE TP LINK ROUTER IS AMAZING - I JUST WISH THEY HAD A GIGABYTE FUNCTION.",

I have always had a lot of luck with other TP-Link Product so I thought I'd take a chance. I chose to purchase the Factory Certified Refurbished Unit which saved me about $50. Item did not arrive in the original packaging but was well packaged and had all of the pieces as described. Router was also in near mint condition which I was very happy about. So far, I am extremely pleased with the performance of AXE5400 router. Very Powerful Processor and connects a ton of devices without issue unlike my old NetGear Router that maxed out at around 20 devices. I don't have a need to subscribe to the HomeShield service so I can't comment on that. But the built GUI combined with the Tether App gives me just about everything I need as it relates to configuring my network. The only issue I have with the AXE5400 is the Access Control feature. It allows you to white list and blacklist devices but it doesn't have a feature to automatically block any new device until I unblock it which my Netgear router did have. I like having that ability in a router but sadly the AXE5400 does not support it which is the reason for 4 stars and not 5. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with the performance.",

      "body": "My old AX1800 WiFi 6 router had started to randomly drop WiFi connections which required a router power cycle to restore. I decided this would be a good time to take the next step to a WiFi 6E tri-band router which adds the 6 GHz band. I chose the AXE5400 router because I did not want to invest a lot in a 6E router knowing the range limitations of the 6 GHz band. I chose the AXE5400 because it is supposed to have good range, at least for the 2.4/5 GHz bands.\n\nSetup was extremely easy. I used the same local network IP address, SSIDs and passwords as my old router. I also enabled the unified 2.4/5 GHz bands. I connected the router to my WAN and LAN and powered it up. I was impressed that in a very few minutes, all my devices connected to their proper WiFi band. I had no issues with the 2.4 GHz only devices connecting to the correct band. I also created guest SSIDs for all 3 bands. Our only 6E devices are our Motorola Edge (2021) cell phones running Android 12.\n\nTo check out the range of the router, I am using the Android WiFi Analyzer app, from the Play Store, installed on my cell phone. There are many discussions on the internet concerning the range limitations of the 6 GHz WiFi 6E band. Yes, the 6 GHz band has serious range limitations that make its use on mobile devices somewhat useless.\n\nI measured the 6 GHz strength through 1, 2 and 3 walls at the distance my phone dropped the connection. All measurements are taken at full transmit power and 80 MHz bandwidth (BW).\nFor 6 Ghz through 1 wall the connection was dropped at 35 ft and -70db.\nFor 6 Ghz through 2 walls the connection was dropped at 30 ft and -73db.\nFor 6 Ghz through 3 walls the connection was dropped at 25 ft and -75db.\nThe 5/2.4 GHz bands at high power easily covers a 100 ft radius, while the 6 GHz band is doing good to get 30 ft. I usually run the 5/2.4 GHz bands at medium transmit power as I don‚Äôt need 100 ft range. It is interesting to note that the 5/2.4 GHz bands are still reliable at -75db, while the 6Ghz band is only reliable down to -70db on my phone. At -70db, my phone disconnects, but after a minute or two, sometimes it reconnects. As the 6 GHz band is so low power, when my phone connects to my WiFi, it almost always connects the 5 GHz band. This makes 6 GHz band on a mobile device kind of hit and miss. Our house is 1-story, 2400 sq ft, and 6 GHz cannot cover the whole house.\n\nFor a more reliable WiFi 6E router with good coverage, I feel a multi-node mesh router is required. The problem I see with a 6E mesh is that if one uses WiFi for the back-haul, it reserves the whole 6 GHz band for back-haul, so you are back to a dual-band router for connected devices.\n\nI will eventually buy a WiFi 6E mesh router system, but it must use Ethernet back-haul so I can use all 3 bands. I would like to see the mesh nodes powered by the Ethernet (POE) so all I need is to run Ethernet with POE to each node. It may also be good if this mesh could be ceiling or wail-mounted to give a more flexible placement and allow them to be mounted high for better range. I could not fine any TP-Link WiFi 6E POE routers yet‚Ä¶I can wait.\n\nUpdate 1 Mar 24:\nAt around a year of use, the WiFi became useless. I used to get good throughout until around 14 Jan 24, when it dropped from 106/268 Mbps to 13/26 Mbps. I have gotten as low as 2/17 Mbps, so I have dropped my rating another star. Now it is a definitely do not buy. I bought a TP-Link Deco X55 (AX3000) to replace it. At least it works, and I get better range even with only the main router.\n\nI do not recommend this router as the 6 GHz band is almost useless.",

If you want to make a statement that you are a power user, this is the router you want.\n\nMy ISP plan is 800 mpbs, but I am running around 930 mpbs using a DOCSYS 3.1 cable modem. If I decide to upgrade even further, this router can handle it. If you Internet plan is 400 mbps or slower, you can easily use a WiFi 5 (AC) or WiFi 6 (AX) router which will be considerably less expensive.\n\nThis is a WiFi 6e modem which includes a 6 MHz band in addition to the more common 2.4 gHz and 5 gHz bands. Furthermore, there are two 5 gHz bands. Please note that there are very few devices that currently support the 6 gHz band. My Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra phones do have that capability. Some Windowsx 11 computers support 6 gHz; currently Windows 10 does not support 6 gHz, even if you install the proper adapter; Microsoft has chosen to block 6 gHz on Windows 10. There are workarounds if you insist.\n\nUsing a chanel width of 160 mHz on one of the two 5 gtHz bands, I am getting upload and download speeds of 1815/2402 mbps. That gives me Speedtest rates of 400 mpbs over WiFI which is half my Internet band plan. That is excellent as you cannot ever get the same speed over WiFi that you can achieve over wired Ethernet.\n\nI am using a 2.5 gb Ethernet connection from my router to my primary computers. The router compes with two 10 gbe ports and one 2.5 gbe port allowing you to get around the speed limitations of routers that only employ 1 gbe ports.\n\nThus, if you are a power user and can afford this device, you will be pleased.\n\nPlease be aware that WFi 7 routers will be introduced over the coming year.

The Tether app is great, not perfect but has been instrumental in the great operation of my network. Just upgraded my extender to RE815XE which has matching features including the addition of the 6G band. I have iPhone 15 Pro‚Äôs and the new band works well and the TP-LINK Mesh network is working very well. Best WiFi net I have ever had.",

      "body": "Whew! What a WiFi journey this has been.\n\nI have a metal building beside my house, approximately 100' away, and needed something to get WiFi to it after my ASUS started crashing perpetually. In hindsight, I probably should've just bought another ASUS, because it was great (until it finally wasn't)\n\nI recently purchased an AX73 to replace my ASUS after reading good reviews about its range, then when I realized the AXE75 existed, I immediately purchased it with the intent to return the 73. I thought it would be a step up. However, once I got it installed, I could barely get any signal or throughput in my shop, even if I rolled all the bay doors up in an effort to have no metal in the signal path.\n\nI run an MSI laptop on one of my workbenches for my business, and it received the ASUS with no problems whatsoever. The laptop picked up the AX73 at 2-3 out of 4 bars on 5GHz, and 3-4 out of 4 on 2.4GHz, but when I installed the AXE75, I could just barely get 1 bar of 5GHz and nothing on 2.4GHz.\n\nMy case is probably a little odder than most, and I'm sure some people have the luxury of using a mesh mode in conjunction with multiple routers to extend their coverage. I don't want a router in my shop due to the extreme elements (metal dust, etc. from metal work and fabricating), so I want something that gets it done and can stay in the safety of my home. If you find yourself needing the most range for your buck, go with the AX73.\n\nAlso, I like the Tether app. It's more of a novelty in my situation; being out in the country I really don't have to worry about anyone else picking up our WiFi. However, in dense housing, particularly a multi-family dwelling, I could really see the benefit to having the tight-knit control of who/what is accessing your network.",

      "body": "I've been in IT for the better part of 20 yrs so I have used a lot of brands. I get bored seeing overly verbose reviews, TLDR. So here is what my general perception is. I have use TP Link on and off for various network items. They've always been solid. This router is no exception. My biggest complaint with setup is that they had to put plastic wrap on the antennas. Everything has to be wrapped. Anyway, this router was replacing a Netgear Orbi mesh system that was just slow to transmit. I didn't have signal issues, firmware updated, it was just slow. Not going to bore you with all my attempts to improve. This system was legitimately out of box and running in 10-15 mins. It's very straightforward and that includes me tweaking settings. I recommend you do it from a PC and not Tether App since you will have more options, as usual, from the web interface. Immediately the speed difference was noticeable and the lag was gone. Everything I loaded was faster. All web, email, etc. speed tests also indicated an increase as well. This is a single unit but with Mesh expanability of course, a feature I liked. In my 2500 SF 2 story, signal strength is strong on all 3 levels and I haven't found any dead zones. All devices immediately grabbed new signal. The one issue I had is that firmware would not auto update. I had to grab it from mfg website. Not a big deal but an extra step. One thing I did love was the addition of a reboot schedule. We all know that from time to time these things need a kick in the butt. Why it took so long to see this option, I have no idea. It's the little things right? So I'm my first 48 hours. I'm very happy. I have an older model Archer running at my Mother in Laws that has served her rock solid for several years. I'm hoping for the same!",

Never slowed down, never... well... anything. Just worked at full speed flawlessly. The wireless is strong and fast, but 6E of course is line of sight only.

      "body": "Purchased and returned and I'll explain why to make you aware of things I noticed about Wifi 6E and 6ghz.\nI'm not a techy, just a guy who understands and can see how things fit in the grand scheme of WiFi so I'll be writing in general terms. Scenario prior to purchase: 1 TP-Link Wifi 6 router without one mesh compatability, 1 Ring Doorbell, 1 Ring Chime Pro, 1 TP-Link Wifi 6 extender capable of one mesh if wanted, and many TV streaming devices located throughout the home. Bought this new router, set it up, (it's no different than any other TP-Link router using the Tether App or on computer. Every device I own connected perfectly, no issues, with the exception of one device, the Ring Chime Pro. 5 hours of tech support to Ring, TP-Link, and my Internet provider, and still no go. Ring even sent me a new Chime to see if that did the trick, and nope. On a whim I reconnected my old Wifi 6 router and boom everything worked including the Chime. Reconnected the new Wifi 6E router and the Chime Pro was a brick. So what I think you should be aware of with Wifi6E is that there's a chance that something or many things, will not work. The technology is new and I'm guessing that there are some kinks that need to be resolved.\nAnother thing you should be made aware of is if you have cordless phones, which most households do, I'm not sure, but the addition of the 6ghz band could cause interference with the phones. People calling us voiced concerns over the quality of the signal, warping of the voices, etc. and you can here weird things at times.\nThe last thing: Both the 2.4 and 5ghz bands were actually weeker than in my old router, and I'm thinking here that the 6ghz may be pulling down the other 2 a bit. 6ghz doesn't travel very far in the home, and if you have no devices in your home that suport it then it's basically useless. My phone is the only one that can connect to it and I couldn't use it in half the house.\nSo my advice for what it might be worth: I'd wait for the technology to catch up to itself, including the extenders, TV streamers, etc. Maybe by then the prices for them will come down also.\nI returned this and got the next level up of my TP-link router that supports one mesh but only Wifi 6. Works like a champ on everything, and the phones cleared up too.\nHope this helps.",
