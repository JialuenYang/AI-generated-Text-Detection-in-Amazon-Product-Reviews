However, it hasn't posed any issues during normal use.\n\nCord Management (5/5):\nThe cord management system is efficient, keeping cables organized and out of sight. It contributes to a neat and tidy appearance, eliminating the clutter often associated with charging multiple devices.\n\nPrice and Value (4.5/5):\nWhile not the most budget-friendly option, the FATORRI End Table justifies its price with its combination of charging convenience, design aesthetics, and build quality. It adds both functionality and style to my living room.\n\nIn conclusion, the FATORRI End Table with Charging Station delivers on its promises of modern design and practical functionality.
