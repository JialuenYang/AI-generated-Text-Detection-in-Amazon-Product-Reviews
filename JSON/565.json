      "body": "My daughter wore this sweatshirt on Valentine's Day to school, and it was perfect! The fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable, which is important for a toddler who is always on the move. The size was just right, providing a comfortable fit without being too tight or too loose. She loved the design and felt special wearing it on Valentine's Day. The best part is that it's versatile enough to be worn on a normal day as well. Overall, we're very happy with this sweatshirt and would highly recommend it to other parents.",
