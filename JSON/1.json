			"title": "Really really really good.***Update***",
			"body": "I am a rare duck in the tech space as I really don't have a preference between Android and iOS. I have traditionally carried an Android phone and used Apple tablets and laptops. I just honestly find Samsung's innovation in hardware more intriguing. That said, I recently bought a new iPhone 15 Pro for a second phone to leave in my house and saw these new Airpods on sale, so I scooped them. The move to USBC convinced me I need to try both. I have used darn near every credible earbud that has come to market in the last four years. Sony, Bose, B&W, Anker, Apple, Beats, Sennheiser, and many others. I have been chasing the perfect set. I think I found them here or, at the very least, found the closest thing there is to perfection. Here are my thoughts on the new Airpods Pro2:\n\nSound: This is the one area that they don't win hands down, but they sound great. Many of my buds feature larger more well tuned drivers. Some even have dual drivers. Many have the option to upscale to more lossless sound by using AptX. None of that is here, but what Apple has done with sound is commendable. There is good separation between the highs, mids, and lows. Unlike previous Airpods, these things bring a very solid low end that can rumble a bit. I am not an audiophile, but these sound really good. I still think that the new Sony buds and Sennheiser buds are better but it isn't a landslide. Apple has nailed it with active noise cancelling here as well. While the Bose Quiet Comfort buds are still the GOAT for me, these are at least as good as the runner up from Sony. These block out all but the most sudden noises. Really good all around.\n\nCall quality: These are easily the best there is for calls. It really isn't close. They do an unbelievable job of masking background noise so folks on the other end can hear you. I was on a call with a friend who was using them as well and his son was in the background gaming. He was yelling at the game and, occasionally when he spoke, I could pick up on it a bit, but only when he spoke. The processing here is just so good.\n\nForm Factor: I hate stem style buds generally, but these are solid. They are light and have real balance in the ear. I think because the Pro's have silicone tips they just work better for me. The squeeze functionality makes these so accurate to use when compared to others that rely on tapping and the swipe volume control is really outstanding. For my ears, and this is subjective for sure, these are all day comfortable. You get a solid IP54 water and dust resistance, so these will hold up well in the gym.\n\nBattery Life: These are average in this space when compared with their peers. I am getting about five hours on bud. You get another three to four charges from the case. Many others are better here, but I find battery life to be perfectly acceptable for everyday use.\n\nIntangibles: There are almost too many things to mention here. First, the case is, as always, the best in the business. It is tiny, solid, packs a great battery, and has the most satisfying magnetic click when closing. I love the spatial audio. It is gimmicky but really fun when it is executed properly during a show or movie. The speech detection is amazing. As is the easy pairing and use on the iPhone. Find my buds is the BOMB. There is so much more that I will update later. These are very well thought out.\n\nConclusion: For me, Apple has crushed it here. Having FINALLY moved to USBC (even if it took the EU to force them) makes all Apple things so much better. These buds might not be the best at much, but they are very good at everything. I can honestly say that these are the best buds on the market. Will I use others for different occasions? Yes, but I doubt that as long as I have an iPhone, I will use many of them often. Buy these now with complete and total confidence. Wow Apple, just wow! Well done!\n\n***Update*** So, I am three weeks in with these and I have a couple of other thoughts I should add. First, the thing that jumps off the page to me is the speaker built into the case. I have owned dozens of buds and this is a first to me. It is awesome. The case chimes when the buds are properly returned to the case. You get a low battery notification and it is also used to “find my AirPods.” It is simply brilliant and an example of how thoughtful some of Apple’s designs are. The case is simply next level and that means more than most people think since you interact with it regularly. The other thing that stands out is how much customization there is and how intuitive it is to set up in your settings. Sony offers similar customization and, in some ways more, but it takes a lot more work. Like I said, there are better options for a lot of things, but the polish and attention to detail here from Apple make these a clear winner overall. If you are on the fence, don’t be. I will update with anything else but these are easily the best all around buds on the market. Buy with confidence",

			"title": "A Remarkable Upgrade in Wireless Audio - Perfect for the Avid Traveler and Fitness Enthusiast",
			"body": "I recently upgraded to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) and have been thoroughly impressed with their performance. The sound quality is a standout feature; it's rich and immersive, making every listening experience a delight. The high notes are crisp, and the bass is deep, thanks to the Apple-designed H2 chip.\n\nThe active noise cancellation is particularly impressive.

They've held up perfectly with no issues.\n\nThe Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is a game changer. It creates an immersive sound experience, placing audio all around you. This feature, along with Dolby Atmos compatibility, elevates the overall audio experience.\n\nThe touch controls on the stem for playback and calls are intuitive and a welcome improvement over the tapping feature. They are easy to use and responsive.\n\nBattery life is another strong point. The AirPods last a long time on a single charge, and I can comfortably wear them all day without worrying about them dying. The charging case also offers ample battery life, ensuring I'm rarely without power.\n\nWhile I haven't used some of the additional features like Precision Finding, Conversation Awareness, or the lanyard loop, the overall package of these AirPods Pro is exceptional. They connect seamlessly to my devices, pause music when taken out, and offer a truly magical experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for quality, convenience, and versatility in their earbuds.

			"title": "Beyond Wireless",
			"body": "The Apple AirPods Pro provide several improvements over competing wireless earphones on the market as they go into their second iteration. The introduction of USB-C charging is a useful advancement that offers users additional rapid and adaptable charging choices. Because of USB-C, this update is possible. While still following conventional charging guidelines, the latest update simplifies the process of using the AirPods Pro.\n\nThese headphones have amazing active noise cancellation (ANC), which is up to twice as effective as previous versions. Because it enables listeners to focus on the audio without being distracted by background noise or voices, this innovation is especially useful in busy areas. Because of its remarkable potency, the ANC technique offers clients a soundscape that is practically unparalleled.\n\nAnother useful feature is the Transparency Mode, which allows the user to move between noise isolation and ordinary hearing with ease. This is an important development in the business when it comes to keeping an eye on your surroundings, whether you're conversing with someone or strolling through a busy location.\n\nApple's Adaptive Audio, which enhances the listening experience using artificial intelligence, is a fantastic illustration of innovation. Regardless of your location, the earbuds' excellent audio quality is ensured by their ability to detect and adjust to their environment. A listener's listening experience can be greatly enhanced by having this kind of customizing choices.\n\nTailored spatial audio raises the level of immersion to completely new heights and allows for a more personalized experience. This technology tracks the user's head movement dynamically and creates an immersive, multidirectional, spatialized audio experience. This amazing feature comes in very handy for individuals who want their audio to sound more like it was made for those platforms—gamers and movies.\n\nThe comfortable and secure fit of the stylish yet functional AirPods Pro is guaranteed by their high-quality construction, which is still produced to an exceptionally high standard. The touch-sensitive interface offers straightforward and easy control over services like calls, music, and other items. The earbuds fit well and are a great choice for people who lead active lifestyles because they stay in place regardless of what the wearer does.\n\nThe best connectivity of any headphones available on the market is found in Apple's AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), thanks to their stable and intuitive Bluetooth connection. Positive impressions are enhanced by the simple method of connecting with an iOS iPhone or any other device that is compatible.\n\nThese high-end wireless earbuds are justified in price for those who anticipate it due to their improved audio quality, more functionality, and easy interaction with the Apple ecosystem.\n\nWith their remarkable performance, sophisticated appearance, and state-of-the-art features, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) have finally raised the bar for wireless headphones. Because the earbuds are wireless, this achievement was made feasible. These earbuds are a great choice for anyone who loves music and travels regularly, as well as anyone who is interested in technology, because they provide an amazing and immersive audio experience while adhering to the Apple idea.",

			"title": "Absolutely worth it, to me.",
			"body": "I understand the rave reviews. The audio quality is outstanding for a Bluetooth device. I’m 65, yet even at very low volume high/mid/ low pitches are sharp and clear.\nThe active noise cancelling completely muffles sounds as diverse as barking dogs, TVs, a crackling fireplace, and the high-volume cacophony found driving a semi at 80mph. I don’t have to *pretend* I don’t have to pretend I didn’t hear my wife and her honey-do list.\nI do find the conversational awareness feature is.. a little slow to recognize I’m talking or somebody’s else is. It’s only a couple seconds, but that’s enough to sometimes miss important data. Still, going into it with that in mind, it’s an outstanding feature.\nI’d love to go *squeee*! over the spacial audio. I would, if virtually everybody else weren’t doing the exact same thing. I will simply say I wish I’d bought a SA device when they first came out. It’s scary good. Even after a month or more of using these daily, I still marvel at it.\nPhone calls in noisy environments could be better. While I can hear the other end just fine even if I’m standing next to a loud generator, the microphone control/noise cancelling makes it difficult for the person on the other end to understand me. My Bluetooth headset- with a boom mic- handles this much better. Yes, there’s a huge difference in both the distance from mouth to mic and in the actual direction of the sounds from my mouth. Apple has done a great job, but.. a headset with a boom mic would do you better for phone calls in a noisy environment.\nThe manual controls on the stem are a nice idea. They probably work well if you have normal sized fingers. My hands and fingers are larger that those of most people. While I can use the stem control, I generally have to be a little careful or I’ll send the wrong signal. It’s not a big issue and I’ve acclimated to it, and it’s to be expected with the shorter stems on the Pro version. The system works well, just be prepared for a learning curve, even if it is shallow.\nFor me and my use- mostly listening to audio with maybe two calls a day- a full charge lasts pretty close to five hours. Nothing I’ve done really makes much of a difference.\nI’ve found that charging the Air Pods from zero to 100% takes about half an hour in the supplied MagSafe charger. The charger itself takes about the same amount of time to go from 40% to 90+%. Less than an hour to reach 100%. Note, I don’t have a wireless charger. I plug it into a 2W wall brick. The case would probably charge a lot faster on a good wireless pad.\nOne thing I don’t like, though I can’t really offer a better solution is that I can’t tell the charge status of the case without the air pod inside. Yes, there’s an amber/green momentary LED on the case, but is too broad an indicator for my taste. To get an accurate figure, you have to put the air pods in the charging case and open it near your phone or iPad. That’s … clunky. I know other systems would use more power, but call me obsessive. Maybe just let me ask Siri?\nAir Pods Pro (v2) comes with four sets of silicone tips that are easily changed to fit your ear canal. They are very comfortable and are part of the noise cancellation system. For all that Apple should be lauded for not trying to go with a “one size fits all “ solution, none of the tips actually fit me all that well. While all sizes did their job noise cancelling, after an hour or so they need to be reseated. On more than one occasion I’ve had an air pod fall out of my ear while I’m simply walking. It’s much worse if I’m eating or talking. I honestly don’t know how they could do a better job given the job requirements, just be aware these don’t fit deep in the ear canal like hearing aids.\nFinally, the color. At first I was mildly unhappy that white is the only color choice. After having the fall out of my ear more than once and simply dropping them because I’m clumsy, I’ve come to realize the color is a brilliant choice. Basically, they’re easy to find no matter where I’ve dropped them. I didn’t even have much of a problem when I dropped one in a foot of snow.\n\nAll in all, the Apple Air Pods Pro (v2) aren’t perfect. There’s definitely room for improvement. But not much. They’re quite a bit more expensive than I really wanted to pay. But, having done so, I’m glad I did. There are better similar audio systems out there, but they aren’t - in my opinion- worth the price difference. I almost gave them 5 stars, but.. the charge status system just annoys me. It’s just too clunky.\nIn spite of that, I’m very glad I opted to spend the bucks to get Apple Air Pods Pro.",

I actually prefer my knockoff $70 earbuds for music. i love bass and these things have none, despite having 10mm drivers.\n\nunless you are an audiophile or you plan to only use these earbuds to listen to music in your room, then these are for you. In all other aspects, these buds are great, especially if you have an iphone. the transparency mode is great (you can customize it in your phones settings once you click on your buds in the bluetooth section) and so is the conversation awareness. i wanted buds that were versatile since i wanted to use them on the move. These also have industry leading noise cancellation (all noise cancellation doesnt eliminate all sound, just background sound and muffles loud sounds). their adaptive NC is also pretty cool. not enitrely noticable until you turn on the fan in the bathroom or turn on water in your sink; then the ANC kicks in. works well in busy enviroments.\n\nspacial audio is kinda cool, makes sound fun as you play around. works really well with movies, but for music i turn it off.\n\nonly buy if you plan on using these for more than music, but also videos and podcasts and such. dont buy if you plan to only use them at home. these are great when your on the go or on a worksite.\n\nif you want really good earbuds strictly for listening to music in your home, then check out the status between 3 ANC eatbuds. they look bulky but for a good reason. sound is out of thsi world, bass, mids, and treble thanks to its triple driver system.they also have transparency and noise cancelling, just not as good as apple. get them for serious music listening, get airpod pro 2s for convenience and on the go.",

			"title": "HUGE improvement over my Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones",
			"body": "To be fair, the QC35s are older, but, if you look at the noise reduction curve and compare it to the AirPods Pro 2, you wouldn’t think there would be much of a difference (I was worried about that, on paper it doesn’t look like a huge upgrade). There is, the difference is night and day. The QC35s served me well, but the AirPods Pro 2 do a substantially better job at masking HVAC noise, and even television. My kitchen table has a direct line of sight to the TV in the family room. I’d say where I sit and where the TV is is probably 25 to 30 feet away and I can’t hear the TV when other family members are watching. I’m currently sitting at the counter of the coffee shop in the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex at Northeastern University. There’s two students about 12 feet away chatting up a storm about statistics. The ANC is blocking out most of the noise from the espresso machines, and if I put on some music at a very low volume, I can hardly hear anything else. It’s kind of like the Cone of Silence from Get Smart… although in this case it’s actually silent. I know some people go to coffee shops to work. I’m not one of those people. I cannot concentrate if there’s chit chat and other noise distractions happening around me. With these ear buds, I could play some ambient noise (birds chirping, babbling brook, etc.) and actually get work done.\n\nAudio quality… they’re sometimes a bit bass heavy, this tends to be more of an issue with music that was mastered for Dolby Atmos. Dolby Atmos mixes tend to be hit or miss. Norah Jones’ debut album which has been remastered for Dolby Atmos for example is fantastic. Other mixes, not so much. YMMV. This however is not a function of the AirPods, but rather the mastering treatment. If you switch over to just stereo, things are balanced again.\n\nComfort - They work for my ears/physiology. That might not be the case for everyone.\n\nCompared to my 2nd gen AirPods… love the “transparency” feature which automatically reduces the volume of whatever you’re listening to, turns off the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), and uses the built in mics so you can hear what’s going on around you. This can be set to automatically engage when you start talking. There’s some cool accessibility features as well, but I’m not using them.",

Since I’m already an Apple user, it is only natural to choose the AirPod.., there are 2 choices…\n1. The regular AirPod &\n2. The AirPod Pro\nHaving reviewed online by some gurus, I’ve decided on the latter for a slightly higher price of better sound quality and a few rubber ear pieces of different sizes, plus the possibility of using it as a hearing aids.\n\nThe item arrived in perfect condition. But disappointed to NOT see any detailed operating instructions. As usual, b4 using the pair, I charged them fully first. The pair already had about 70% charge. So it did not take long to charge it fully.\n\nThen I put them on… I hardly get any sound. I saw the brief leaflet to rub the stem up and down to adjust volume. But there were no written instructions on how to do this. I rubbed the stems of both units. No luck. Then I went to my phone to see if I could raise the volume. No luck either.\n\nAlright, I could tolerate that for now. I played some YouTube videos. But I was surprised that the charge rapidly decreased. Not good.\n\nRealizing the holder case can act as a charger while on the road, so I put them back to the case. Fairly quickly, (less than 30 minutes), they were fully charge. Good.\n\nAfter using the paid for a day or two, I went online to look for ways to raise or lower volume. Turns out that only the stem on the right side unit has that function, there was a short strip of flat surface on the stem that a user can rub it up to raise or down to change volume. Got it. I’m still getting used to this feature. Clumsily changing the volume as I use it.\n\nThen I watched a video on how to setup the pair to act as hearing aids. This part is still a puzzle. So far, no luck. I haven’t given up on this yet.\n\nIn reality I don’t expect this gadget ti effectively enhance hearing. Not a deal breaking thing. And Apple does not claim this product as hearing aids.\n\nAlso, on the side of the charging case, there is a place that a user can attach a lanyard for carrying around. There was no such lanyard included in the package. But the package came with a usb-c to lightning cable. I don’t need it.\n\nI think I’m going to keep this pair as music enjoyment.",

The bad news was that it started having issues over time. It finally gave out so I had to buy another one.\n\nI love the new feature where you are able to adjust the volume right from the ear piece. It takes a bit of trial and error though to figure out that you don't just slide up/down the button on the ear piece. The end of the notch is where the sound adjustment happens. The sliding up with a bit of a hit at the top or the bottom will turn the volume up or down respectively.\n\nI have not tried other in-ear noise cancelling headsets so I can't say how this compares to those other in-ear ones. However, I do own the Bose 700, an over the head noise cancelling headset. I have tried both of these on an international flight. The results were very comparable to me. I like the in-ear design so you can put your head down easier. Furthermore, because the microphones for the noise cancelling function is not covered by the headrest or your pillow, the in-ear design actually works better if you are trying to get some rest.\n\nOverall, a great product.",

The issue that I run into most is the earbuds not staying in under the ear protection, regular AirPods are plain frustrating in that regard, but these guys are gold.\nThey’re shorter than the regular AirPods, and the rubber fittings are perfect. They don’t hurt my ears after long use, even with the added pressure of ear protection.\n\nOutside of work though, the amount of control and customization you’re given is fantastic; I didn’t even realize earbuds could be this great.\n\nHooking them up to my Xbox has made horror games a whole new world of spooky. Full 360 surround experience.\n\nOnly thing I’d say is the actual charging for the earbuds still requires a clean connection between them and the physical components of the case. With wireless charging, and a $200 price tag, physical contact charging feels like a downgrade. I only really notice this because my job is dusty, and getting dust in there when I’m switching them out worries me that buildup will make it so they can’t charge, and cleaning the area always has a possibility of damaging the components.\n\nOverall, I’d say spend the extra money for the pros.

			"body": "I finally stopped resisting and got myself a set of airpods, and really wish I had done so sooner. These are every bit of the quality and high standard that's expected with Apple products (and the premium price to go with it).\n\nI needed some kind of hands free earbuds or bluetooth device for Teams and phone calls, and tried all kinds of things, spent over $200 with Jabra and got something that had a complicated app, poor running time, and ultimately was terrible for calls, picking up a lot of noise especially wind noise when outside. Then I bought 2 different Bluetooth headsets from Plantronics and couldn't find anything approaching an actual good level of quality, even after spending upwards of $100.\n\nSyncing the Airpods to my iPad tablet, Windows computer, and Samsung smartphone worked great and was easy. It also seems to do well at \"sensing\" what device I'm trying to use, if I put the earbuds in while joining a teams call or phone call it usually is already connected without needing to do a lot of switching in the device. Finally, active noise cancelling is a huge benefit. I fly a lot and don't know what I'd do without noise cancelling on a plane.\n\nFinally, the downsides: First, the Find Me software is useless. These are supposed to have Airtags built in, for both the case and the airpods themselves, but it doesn't seem to work, and it's a well known problem, with several pages of threads on Apple's support forums. I've tried resetting absolutely everything and my iPad won't see the airpods on the list, even if it's connected to them via bluetooth and they're right next to it. So beware of that, if you're expecting their AirTag service to find these when you lose them - it won't. Fortunately you can buy replacement parts, aftermarket cases are as low as $35, and Apple sells individual buds for about $80 each.\n\nSecond and it goes along with the first problem, but the case lid is \"flappy\" for a lack of a better word. It doesn't really latch, which means if you drop the case, the lid is apt to flap open and the airpods will tumble out with it. Which that going along with the problem of the Find Me software not working right becomes a real issue. With Find Me failing you can't even \"beep\" them like you're supposed to be able to do, when I lost them once (cats ended up knocking them off the table then carrying them around the house like toys) I ended up just forcing them to be on in the bluetooth settings (even if not in your ear) and then just playing loud beeps through a youtube video. A far less elegant workaround to a feature that should just work.",

I searched the Apple 🍎 store among other places before I made the commitment to get these through Amazon. Yes! Amazon has the best deal out there for new AirPodsPro2! Honestly you can’t beat Amazon for these. Plus you are able to add the Apple Care+ to the purchase and don’t have to do anything special you just order them, and these arrived actually a few days earlier than anticipated! Yay. They immediately connected to my iPhone 15 PM and when I went into the my support app on my iPhone, and found my new Air Pods listed there in my devices the 🍎Care+ was already updated without me having to do a single thing. So that was a very streamlined process. I wanted to share that in case anyone out there was wondering, because I was, I’ve never purchased an Apple 🍎 product that didn’t come directly from Apple! These AirPods are fabulous, my last set could never understand my talk to text or my Siri wouldn’t understand what I was saying. These are spot on. I’ve caught maybe two mistakes in a week. Rather than two every text message. So so happy with this. Sounds amazing of course. More options and better battery, also check out the specs. Worth it.

In general, phone calls work well and only rare instances of \"hiccups\" that usually clear themselves up.\n\nAt the sale price, it was a great buy and glad I got these to go with my phone and computer.

			"body": "Great Apple product that syncs well within their ecosystem. My thoughts below on it's most useful features, pros and cons, and overall review.\n\n1. Noise Cancellation:\nThe noise cancellation feature is fantastic, although not the best you can get if you're looking for close to 100% cancellation. However, this noise cancellation is plenty enough for daily use purposes (block out city noise, ambient noise, almost all plane rumblings, etc.) The other pass through option is also extremely useful and you will find yourself using it most, if not all the time while listening to music or simply just having the ear buds sitting in your ears.\n\n2. Fit, Sizing, and Comfort:\nSIzing on the tips comes in different sizes, so finding a good fit won't be much of a problem. For those who can never find a good fit, they make customer or specialized ear hole tips (purchased separately) that can be attached on with eaze. I can also wear these up until they die (4-6 hours depending on use) and have even fallen asleep with them on with no trouble. I find these ear hole tips an upgrade from the version without rubber tips as it keeps the Airpod from falling out of your ears during movement.\n\n3. Pros/Cons:\nHonestly, the pros outweigh the cons. The list of features and technology on this device are amazing and have daily use cases. The only con I can possibly think of is that they don't have the highest grade of noise cancellation, but as I stated before it is plenty enough for almost all your use cases.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nGreat product, easy to get them running and super easy to use on the daily. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of wireless earbuds.",

If you need to use them for hours you can just use one with one charging then trade off and you'll get I think 24 hours out of it. Not that most people are awake for that long. Some medical staff maybe. These are definitely worth getting! I've tried cheaper, kind of pricey earbuds but they just would only pair once and then would not stay paired! It was very frustrating! They would pair and then just disconnect! Even Skullcandy earbuds that are pretty pricey like $60-$80.

Everyone is ga-ga about boosting base, but i need to boost the treble frequencies. These allow you to do that, to a small degree. I wish some smart app writer would come up with an app that would allow me to set frequency response on these as I like - like a regular equalizer board does - rather than \"is this better?, is that better?\" - that would make these one heck of a product - not only for listening to tunes and movies (which to me are still pretty muddy and way over-based) they would also be one heck of a great hearing aid. I'd pay for that! With the transparent mode boosting treble, it would make conversations much easier, and face it, it's cool to have white earbuds hanging out of your ears, and uncool to have nasty hearing aids that are at best tinny, uncomfortable, and look like crap.

So if you don't have an iPhone, I probably wouldn't recommend these. I love how sleek and compact they are because it makes it so easy to carry them with me everywhere. I personally bought an iPhone 15 Pro this year and I HATED that my old AirPods were the only device that I had that used lightning instead of USB C. So I was able to finally get rid of that lightning charger with these new AirPods.\n\nThe new AirPods pro also have MUCH BETTER battery life, sound quality, and noise cancellation from the old ones. I don't have to charge them nearly as much and they sound even better than they used to!\n\nThey're great for listening to music and taking phone calls (though I sometimes have some friends and family complaining about my call audio when using AirPods.) Being able to have a convenient hands free experience is really important to me.\n\nIn the box, you have multiple tip sizes for the AirPods, so if they don't fit well, make sure you try the other tips before returning. I also like that they added a spot to attach a lanyard. I personally am fine with putting them in my pocket, but I know a lot of people could benefit from that.\n\nHere are some cons/things to think about when buying AirPods:\n-Buy the AppleCare+ - so worth it. I put mine through the washer once and they replaced the whole set for $30. I also had a battery issue with my old ones once and it was free to replace the case. Basically if you damage them, you pay $30 and if there's no damage, there's no deductible. The Apple Store employee told me that I would have had to pay $90 for ONE PIECE if I didn't have AppleCare so totally worth it!\n-If you hate seeing scratches on the white case (not covered by AppleCare) then I would really recommend getting some kind of case. Probably won't do much to protect them, but at least it will keep them looking brand new.\n-If you have an older phone that uses lightning, you might want to think about finding one of the older kinds that has the lightning case. I HATED having to use multiple chargers so if you're like me, then you might want to try to buy those instead...

True to Apple's claims, ANC is more effective and connectivity/switching between my Apple devices is way more reliable than 1st Gen. Here's a quick rundown of the advantages:\n\n- Adaptive mode responds quickly to tune out noise and pass through things like speaking\n- Better noise cancelling and clearer Transparency mode\n- Faster/more reliable connecting/switching\n\nSome nice to have things:\n- USB-C charging <3\n- MagSafe charging + works with Apple Watch charger\n- Speakers built into case for FindMy pings\n\nFor most people, this isn't worth the upgrade if you already have 1st Gen (but I HIGHLY recommend upgrading from non-Pro models if you can afford it), but here is why I did it:\n\nI've been going to a lot of loud concerts for years, and that has caused some damage to my hearing because I foolishly did not wear proper ear protection for too long. I am now *highly* invested in protecting hearing from further damage, and I've spent plenty of time researching and testing some of the best specialty ear plugs on the market.\n\nWhen the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro came out, I immediately started researching whether ANC can actually protect your ears from exceptionally loud environments like concerts, given the incredible sampling rate enabled by the newer H2 chips. I found several reputable sources that confirmed they work for concerts specifically, so I immediately upgraded my 1st Gen set to test at a show in November.\n\nLet me tell you--wow. First of all, well-fitted AirPods Pro block out a ton of sound when they are off. With ANC, outside noise reduction is unbelievable. But the real magic happened when I turned on Adaptive mode. It was like turning the volume down on the entire show to a safe volume without sacrificing sound quality much at all. Only at the absolute loudest volumes—particularly when the bass spiked—did the AirPods noticeably clip from time to time as they tried to quickly adjust to extreme changes in noise levels, but never problematically so.",

Sure, they made hearing phone conversations easier in noisy environments, but I rarely talked on my phone when in public spaces, because, yeah, that felt presumptuous too.\n\nThen I switched to an iPad Pro-Magic Keyboard combo from a Windows laptop as my primary work device, which convinced me to migrate from Android to an iPhone, so investing in AirPods just made sense, given Apple’s matchless ecosystem integration.\n\nNow, when a call comes in via my iPhone, while I’m working and listening to music on the iPad, I can answer the call from the iPad through the same AirPods with zero effort. I just tap and talk as if the iPhone were in my hand. And I can hear the caller even better with the AirPods than with other buds. Plus, the AirPods’ ANC doesn’t cause the mild sense of pressure the others did.\n\nBut that’s not all. The AirPods’ transparency mode is so scary good, I can hear every external sound — especially voices! — better with than without them, and that’s why I’m now tempted to wear them in public and have had to revise my previously negative opinion of others who do.\n\nOh, and the spatial audio feature? I expected that to be a gimmick, but it’s accurate yet subtle, and having tried it, I no longer use the AirPods without it.\n\nBottom line: If you see me out and about with AirPods in my ears, I’m not trying to drown you out. I’m trying to hear you better amid whatever cacophony surrounds us. And as with the iPad, having experienced the AirPods Pro 2, there’s no going back.\n\nI’m not an audiophile, so I can’t rate that aspect of the AirPods. I can only report that the base, mids, and highs sound as crisp and clear as through anything else I’ve used. I listen to recordings now that I first experienced in the ‘50s and ‘60s, and I hear elements I couldn’t know existed back in the days of AM radios with mono speakers. The AirPods have been a revelation in that sense, too.\n\nAs for fit, I travel by bicycle and now wear the AirPods to better hear turn-by-turn directions (for safety, I keep them in transparency mode when on the bike), but however actively I’m pedaling, I haven’t felt at risk of the AirPods falling out of my ears. Plus, they’re comfortable enough that I can wear them the full ~six hours I pedal each day when traveling.\n\nWhat would I change? Well, they’re white, and in my perfect world, they’d be the color of darker skin, so the fact that I’m now a guy who wears AirPods in public wouldn’t be so obvious.

Adjusting the volume is hit or miss. Well, more miss really. Otherwise the long hold / short hold to access the different options works well.\nAnother positive, they didn't irritate my ear. I had the Bose QuietWhatever and while the sound quality was great, they were just uncomfortable to the point where I couldn't use them for more than 10 to 20 minutes.",

Their advanced features like the H2 chip for enriched audio, next-level active noise cancellation, and customizable fit have been crucial. The ability to control external noise levels and choose between complete noise cancellation and transparency mode provides them with a sense of control over their auditory environment. This adaptability has been invaluable during events or in crowded, noisy spaces, offering a comforting \"shield\" without complete isolation.\n\nMoreover, the personalized spatial audio and conversation awareness features contribute to a more immersive and considerate listening experience. The long battery life ensures that my child has consistent access to these features throughout the day. These AirPods Pro have not just been a tech gadget; they've become a significant tool in managing my child's sensory challenges, allowing them to participate more fully in various settings without overwhelming stress or anxiety.

It will automatically decrease passthrough of sounds from things like sinks air dryers and generally loud or disruptive sounds allowing me to hear my music in almost every space. I know Sony had a feature like this but they didn’t seamlessly switch between passthrough and cancelling like this does and with no input from the user. In addition to that there is a setting to intelligently increase and decrease volume based on your surroundings so that you can always hear and I love it, it works so well.

I kept flipping my head left and right to feel how the airpods track me.\n\nBut I arranged for a return because the microphone performance was poor: callers had trouble hearing me through the airpods when I was outdoors. Also, connectivity was not 100%: sometimes audio would cut out abruptly for no apparent reason.\n\nBut then I watched a prime video on ipad with airpods. The sound was clear, dramatic, like being in the theater. And this was just a tv show, not a movie, that i was watching. I was so impressed. I canceled the return.",

These have a very natural sound to them, and really are perfect all-around good ear buds. If I'm consuming media or listening to music these are very good - not perfect in this department, but they are VERY good and have a very balanced sound and great sound stage. These buds are literally second to none in terms of ANC and call/speech clarity. The ANC is the best I've heard in any earbuds - which is also better than the new Sony XM5's in my opinion. Call clarity and speech coming through these things is also second to no other buds I've heard. These are just so good! Then you throw in the added bonus of how seamlessly these integrate with my new phone and watch... I've been missing out not having had this trio until now. I've ascended to a new technological level. I would gladly pay full price for these - but if you can get them on a deal, don't hesitate, just do it.",

The sony earbuds are more expensive, and Santa was unsure if they would fit into my daughter's ears so he got her the airpods. They do come with three seperate sized inserts. The smallest ones fit her ears. She is 8. One other item to know is these are charged with a USB-C connector cable. It does not come with a power block, so if you don't have a USB-C power block better grab one of those.",

I am hopeful that they will last for a long time but I don't see them lasting forever.
