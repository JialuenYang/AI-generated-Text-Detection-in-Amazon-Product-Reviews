			"body": "There are a lot of different gaming mice out there but a lot of gaming mice on the market in my opinion kind of just over do it. They are just way to expensive or have to many unneeded features (like 12+ buttons, covered in rainbow RGB lighting, wireless or have a super weird shape/feel)\n\nI just need a simple gaming mouse…\n\nI was at tech-school for my training in the Air force (I know, weirdest place out of anywhere) and I had my gaming laptop mailed to me so on my days off, I could play games with my sister & friends. For a long time I used a basic Dell computer-lab work mouse, and it gets the job done but I thought maybe it was time for a fun upgrade. There was a GameStop at a mall and there I bought a white colored Razer DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse. I'm going to tell you now… I immediately LOVED it! Perfect balance of a gaming mouse with some cool features but not overdoing it. Exactly as it says in the name… it's the basic essentials for a gaming mouse! And for the price of $30? Not bad at all.\n\nThe size, shape and feel is really good. not overdoing it in my opinion, giving a great ergonomic feeling when in use. The two extra side buttons are great and not overbearing (like with some mice and their 6+ extra buttons all over the mouse) two, in my opinion, are just enough. Lastly the fact that it's wired is nice, helps with price & simplicity. It has some RGB lighting but not all over the place or crazy so no complaints for that.\n\nI rebought one but in the color black so it better matches my laptop and gave my sister the white colored one. Had the white one for almost a year and had ZERO issues or problems with it. If you want a simple, nice and cool gaming mouse that is just the ESSENTIALS this is for you!!!!",

I got it after getting back into PC gaming after a hiatus.\n\nPROS:\n-Feels great in-hand.\n-Cable is plenty long.\n-It's not heavy, but it has a decent weight to it.\n-Build quality is solid.\n\nCONS:\n-The only bad thing I have to say about this mouse is after a couple months of daily use, the scroll wheel sensors don't function properly. After doing some research, it looks like dust builds up on the sensor, making the wheel \"bounce\" when scrolling.\n\nSIMPLE FIX: Blow into the space between the mouse and the scroll wheel. If you have pressurized air that will work much better. It's only a temporary fix, and can get annoying, but it does fix the issue!\n\nOther than that one issue, this mouse is incredible for the price. Likely will upgrade to something a little more \"pro\" in the future, but for the last few months this has held up great, and I'll likely use it for another 6+ months before upgrading.",

I use gaming mice and prefer ones with more than just two side buttons, and a much heavier weight. This is a lightweight mouse which is fine for office work where you're in front of a computer 8 hours a day, but I would much prefer something different for gaming.\n\nBut as a general use office mouse, it works great. It is ergonomic enough to be used right or left handed, the scroll wheel works fine, and the buttons press with a reassuring CLICK. For the price, use this in your office, but if you want to get into a Call of Duty or Fortnight tournament, definitely get something else.",

On the 10th, the right click started acting HORRENDOUS. As in, triple clicking, clicking when not pressing, dropping clicks entirely... Restarting and replugging it did not change a thing. Tested on another PC, same issue. Swapped out cable extenders, same issue. Attempted plugging it directly into the PC, as inconvenient as that would be in my setup... still the issue. Multiple ports, no help.\n\nI firmly believe stuff happens. Quality control is not, and never will be perfect. I ended up reordering this mouse off Wal-Mart to see. So far it is working flawless. The mouse is incredible, I think I got unlucky here... again. I also ordered an EVGA X20 off Amazon. Hope it goes better, too. I still think overall I would recommend this product, as it wouldn't have such a high rating so consistently if this happened incredibly often. I will dock a few starts, but I honestly still think the mouse it good.\n\nX-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X\n\nOriginal post -\nI first ordered a Redragon M910K, and it was faulty. I decided to put 10 extra dollars in and order this mouse instead.\n\nTake note this is a day one review and if I have problems, I will update. Assume this is all still relevant if you see this review after a couple months and I haven't edited it.\n\nFirst Impressions\n-Glide is good. Feels very smooth.\n-Cable pulls the mouse slightly due to the smooth glide. However, not much, and if your cable is tied forward, or simply going straight, you won't notice it. Just don't have your cable go off at an angle immediately and you need not to worry.\n-Feels very... non-durable? I wouldn't slam it. If you aren't a heavy rager, it should be fine. Hit your keyboard instead. NOT CHEAP FEELING THOUGH. Feels perfectly fine for this price!\n-Simple look. Black with Green LED's. Perfect printing on the logo.\n-Side buttons are a bit high for me, if your thumb rests low like mine, you may have a hard time reaching them. That's why the \"Ergonomic\" is a 4 star, but only from a personal stance not an overall stance.\n-Very Comfortable. Enough said\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this, and if this review is un-updated, I still am. Just waiting for the software to install to change my DPI currently. If you are looking for a good mouse below $30, this is a good mouse. A very good mouse.\n\nWould I recommend it at this price range? Yes.\n\nBest regards from a fat idiot",

The mouse also has a slightly matte texture on the top which makes using it enjoyable. Not a very heavy mouse, is a good size for an average length hand.",

I also really, really noticed the very smooth gliding of the mouse, and like this a lot.\n\nI don't do head-to-head gaming; most of my games are solo playing. I don't really see much of a difference with this mouse over the old mice.\n\nI'm really used to 3-button mouse, so I really don't know what to use the two extra mouse buttons for (they are on the left side of the mouse, and they won't be accidentally clicked as long as the grip stays in the lower area. I looked up some suggestions, but I was a bit disappointed that some key combinations don't work (I was hoping to map ctrl+windows+left to one button and ctrl+windows+right to the other, but it doesn't seem to realize when I press the windows button).\n\nThat brings us to the software.. you have to install it to adjust the lights or assign the buttons. The EULA basically says that they collect data on usage. I did want the lights to turn off after a time, and I like the \"breathing\" light... so, for now, I'm running it (the effects don't stick when you don't run the program). I don't trust the software that comes with the mouse. There may be some other way to control it.\n\nAside from the software, I'm impressed by my foray into fancier mice.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIt's been less than a year, and it has worked pretty well. However, as others have noted, the mouse wheel is beginning to give me difficulties. If it gets worse, I will need to replace the mouse, and I won't be buying this brand again.",
