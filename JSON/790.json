      "body": "I recently purchased the Apple Watch Ultra 2 ,and I purchased A different band for my watch which came with a case as well. The issue with that case was that the sensitivity of touching the screen was hard to do any typing on. I remember purchasing this brand for my Apple Watch SE And it worked beautifully. Not only protected my watch the touchscreen was flawless so once I found they made one for the Ultra 2 Watch I bought it the same day. As just Like before, the touchscreen is beautiful and flawless when typing any thing on it. I prefer this screen protector over any screen protector that Amazon has on their website….",

I definitely recommend.!!",

The shield was cracked but the watch was fine. Had I not had it, I would have been out a lot of money!!! Ordering a replacement now!",

For $10 protection lasting 5 months of the brutality of moving, jumping in/on/out/from motorcycle, airplanes, hiking, and working out, I would've liked to past 6 months, to be realistic, bonus if a year, before needing another set. Due to my active lifestyle, the protective case does pop out randomly, easy to snap back into place though. Once water gets between the glass and the watch, you'll have to wipe dry surfaces to get back to touching capability.",

NOPE! My watch was perfectly fine and didn’t even have a scratch on it. The glass case had a hole in it and that’s why I thought my watch was totaled. This product saved my watch and a painful call to Apple care. The nice part is I came home and install the second one that it came with, so it’s fully protected again. So, I have just brought another pack, because, well I’m a clumsy Mfer lol.",

It performs as it should; however, I got water under it (twice) and had to remove the cover so the screen could make positive contact with the screen and when I was putting it back on the second time, the protector cracked. It still works and performs as advertised, and I had bought two. Great product for those who are accident prone, just be careful getting water under it and removing the casing. I'd buy again.",

I am not been too tough on my watch, but have occasionally hit it on walls or doors. The case has protected the watch without cracking or scratching after two months of use.\n\nI've seen some reviews mentioning that water gets underneath the case. It is my understanding that the case isn't intended to be waterproof and only protects from scratches. I never submerge my watch in water and, therefore, have had no issues. If water got under the case, it is fairly easy to remove to allow for drying.",

Touching the screen has to be touched with much greater force and water constantly gets under it from her washing her hands. (I saw this in several reviews and thought people were swimming with it. Once she showed me how water got under it, it was very understandable why a lot of reviews said the same thing.) Wish there was a better way for water to not get under it so easily.",

Other than that it works perfectly. Obviously I don’t have a problem with that as I bought it again.",
