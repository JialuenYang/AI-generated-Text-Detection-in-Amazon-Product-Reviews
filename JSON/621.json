      "body": "I recently purchased the Calf Compression Sleeves for my pregnant wife, and they have been a game-changer! Not only do they provide excellent support for her legs during pregnancy, but they have also effectively relieved her restless legs syndrome. The compression sleeves are incredibly comfortable to wear, and the footless design allows her to wear them with any footwear. Weâ€™ve noticed a significant reduction in swelling, and she feels much more comfortable and supported throughout the day, especially during long periods of standing or walking. These sleeves have become an essential part of her maternity wardrobe, and we highly recommend them to anyone experiencing similar discomfort or looking for reliable compression support.",
