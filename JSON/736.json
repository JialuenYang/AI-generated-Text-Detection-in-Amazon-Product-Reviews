			"body": "Yes they are expensive. But like all the other reviewers say - you get what you pay for. I ended up buying these because I work from home a few days out of the week and my AirPods battery life couldn’t last the whole work day.\n\nThe sound quality is crisp and clean. The battery life is great and the ease of using within an iPhone is great. They are totally comfortable and not heavy at all. However, I will say - I use these sitting at my desk - if you were going to buy these while moving around I wouldn’t really recommend because they could fall off pretty easily.\n\nLastly, yes like other reviewers said - I would have preferred a deeper bass. If you turn up the volume really loud (and these get LOUD) then you can really hear the bass. But at normal listening levels I would have preferred some extra bass. It’s still good - but I just like a deep bass sound.\n\nAnyways, I would highly recommend these headphones despite their steep price.",

			"title": "Bose Noise Canceling 700 vs AirPods Max vs Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra",
			"body": "UPDATE OCT 2023: Here is my original review which still holds true now that I have owned the Bose NC 700 for a couple of years. Last week, I bought the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra over-ear headphones. I added that review and comparison at the bottom.\n\n————————\n\nOriginal review……\n\nFor the past ten years I have enjoyed and been dependent upon noise canceling headphones. With that has come a journey into the audiophile community with others who are on a quest for high-fidelity sound. My journey led me to many headphones that sound absolutely pristine but none with noise canceling and few are wireless. Until late, the Bose Noise Canceling 700 are my compromise for great sound and noise canceling in a wireless headphone. So, when Apple announced the AirPods Max, I had to try them to know how they compare to my Bose 700. Here are my conclusions so far...\n\nSTYLE\n\nThe fit and finish on the AirPods Max is absolutely beautiful! Love it much more than the Bose. I just like the way they look and feel. Before I purchased the AirPods I probably watched 50 unboxing and review videos. So, I thought I had a good idea of how they looked. They are nicer in person. Sleek, premium, modern and minimalistic.\n\nCOMFORT\n\nComfort is about the same! AirPods Max are definitely heavier but do not necessarily feel much heavier on he head as the weight is balanced well. I have larger ears and the ear cups on the Bose 700 go a little deeper to make room for my ears. So, over several hours, the Bose do feel slightly more comfortable. The Bose also do not get as warm as the Apple.\n\nTRANSPARENCY MODE\n\nTransparency mode, in my opinion, is actually more natural on the Bose. The Apple headphones actually amplify the sound around you a few decibles too much. In other words, things sound louder than they actually are with the transparency mode on the AirPods Max. Also, the Bose reproduces your own voice much more naturally when in transparency mode.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nSound quality at certain volume levels is almost exactly the same. Kind of unbelievable. It is as though Apple reverse engineered the Bose 700 and copied its sound signature and noice canceling to within 5 percent. There is a definite sound quality difference though that changes with the volume level. This is all about the DSP. Of course, the digital signal processing (DSP) is called Computational Audio on the Max and Volume Optimized EQ on the Bose. This is what works differently and what accounts for sound differences dependent on the volume. Basically, the Bose sound better at 60 percent volume and below. Bose just has it dialed in so that everything sounds rich and balanced. I usually listen to music at about 55 percent volume on my iPad. So, I prefer the sound of the Bose. The sound at 60 percent and below on the AirPods Max suffers from a veiled upper midrange. An alto saxophone, for example, will sound as though it is being played behind a wooden door.\n\nNow between 60 and 70 percent volume is where both headphones sound virtually the same. It is uncanny! Both sound absolutely wonderful. Probably the best you will ever hear on wireless noise canceling headphones (yes, the Sony has an amplified and unnatural mid-bass making them sound deep but not high fidelity).\n\nAt 70 percent volume and above the Bose DSP begins to lower the bass response to avoid distortion. The bass gets progressively quieter as you increase on the Bose to where there is virtually no bass at about 90 percent volume. The AirPods Max, on the other hand, handle bass very nicely from 70 all the way up to 100 percent. In fact, they sound perfectly balanced all the way from 60 to 100 percent volume with no sound quality degradation. If there is a fault it is that the bass loses a little nuance. In other words at high volumes the bass is a little over controlled. The softer vibrations like on the trail of a bass string get lost a little.\n\nSo to summarize the sound comparisons. The two headphones sound equal from 60 to 70 percent volume. The Bose sound bette at 60 percent volume and below. Finally, the AirPods sound better (by quite a bit, it’s not even close) at 70 percent volume and above.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nThe final comparison are the controls. Apple wins in my book. The Digital Crown has a perfect feel to it. It rotates very smoothly with a perfect amount of resistance. It presses well also. Apple has hyper dialed-in these controls. It makes me never want to have to use the touch-pad on the Bose 700 ever again.\n\nWHICH ONE IS FOR ME?\n\nEverything is comparable on these two headphones, but in the end, sound quality at my preferred listening level wins out. Since I listen to at about 50 percent volume, the Bose continue to be he choice for me. I just have a fixed routine for when I use noise canceling headphones.\n\nNow, I am sure that Apple could probably update their firmware to adjust the computational audio in order to fix the balance issues below 60 percent volume. If they did, then the fit and finish and controls might win me back over to the AirPods Max. But, the slight compromise in long-term comfort would cause me to hesitate a little.\n\nONE LAST THING\n\nOne last thing, the spatial audio is pretty Amazing. If I had to watch movies on my iPad these headphones would be a must. The surround sound effects are as good (slightly better) than my Bose home theatre system. The overall sound quality for movies is slightly less (more sterile and hollow sounding, probably because of the limited Bluetooth codec) than my Bose home theatre system.\n\n—————————-\n\nBOSE QUIET COMFORT ULTRA VS BOSE NC 700 (and AirPods Max)\n\nBose Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones\n\nSeveral years ago, I discovered Bose Quiet Comfort headphones. My first pair wore the QC15 and I have owned every iteration since then. Until now, the best of the best have been the Bose NC700 which are spectacular headphones. Now, I find myself the proud owner of the company’s newest over-ear headset, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra. After thorough comparison, I can confidently say that the new Ultra are an upgrade in every way. There is especially one aspect which causes the Ultra to make them an absolutely must-have for music lovers. I will get to that in a moment, but first here are my thoughts on how the NC700 and QC Ultra compare:\n\nCOMFORT\n\nI am very happy to report that the Bose QC Ultra are more comfortable than the NC 700 headphones. They are lighter, there is less clamping force and the headband distributes weight better on the top of your head. I used to consider the NC 700 headphones as the second most comfortable pair of over-ear headphones second only to the QC45. Well, the Ultra now take this 2nd place spot and they are almost as comfortable as the 45. Very Great!\n\nNOISE CANCELING\n\nYes, Bose has also improved the noise canceling. When in quiet mode the headphones put you in a place where the world simply disappears. Each iteration of Bose headphones through the years has improved upon the previous in this area. The Ultra are no different. In fact, when I was testing them out my wife was standing 3 feet from me and trying to talk to me. I never even knew she was talking. This has never happened with my older NC 700.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nThe QC Ultra are more of a spiritual successor to the NC700 than they are the QC45. The sound is much more similar to the NC700. What they retain is the excellent clarity and instrument separation. The mids are just as perfectly present. Also the highs have a very pleasing ring without ever sounding harsh. What was great on the 700 but even better on the Ultra is the bass. Bose says that the new Ultra are now taking samples of sound inside the ear ups and then actively adjusts the bass to sound best dependent on the shape of ears, the seal of the pads, etc. This really does make a difference. I wear glass which compromises the acoustic seal. The Ultra compensates for this and makes the bass sound deeper and have a greater punch than my NC700. So, the sound signature overall is better and gets WAY better with immersive audio. But, we are getting to that.\n\nIMMERSIVE AUDIO\n\nThis is the feature! If you are a music lover then this is the feature which gives the biggest incentive to upgrade from the NC 700. Music with immersive audio just sounds better. I have several setups of actual stereo bookshelf speakers around my house. I always preferred a good pair of music monitors over headphones. Why? Because you can hear and imagine the soundstage in front of you. Good recordings place an orchestra or band members several feet from each-other as you listen. With live listening you can hear the music spread throughout the venue and this is what immersive audio on the Quiet Comfort Headphones does. It places the band a couple feet in front of you. It feels like you can point to and reach out and touch the various vocalist and instruments. It is so great! It is exactly like advertised. Immersive audio makes it sound like you are listening to a good pair of speakers in a room acoustically ideal for premium audio. Now that I have heard it, I can never go back to regular headphones.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThere is so much more good that I could say about the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. The buttons are well placed and are useful - even the touch-sensitive volume slider works well enough! The app also just works and all the needed settings are there to easily adjust. The carrying case looks premium and is compact. It is smaller than the NC700 case and even more compact than the QC45’s storage option. There are some things I do not like about the headphones. For example, immersive audio for movies is still not as good or immersive as Spacial Audio on Apple’s AirPods Max when watching Dolby content. Also, the placement and function of the buttons is different than what I am used to on the 700. In the end though, I am ecstatic with what Bose has done in their newest iteration of Bose over-the-ear noise canceling headphones. My NC 700 are going on eBay and I look forward to many great years with the Ultra. Well done Bose!",

			"title": "WOW. Especially if you get them at $449 $100 off Apple Store. **edited to add info Logic Pro Ipad**",
			"body": "I have Sennheiser headphones since the 80s. I have studio type corded and bought 2 of the consumer Bluetooth models for $99 each HD405T and I not saying they are expected to be on the same level as these but holy toledo Apple wins here. Most I’ve spent was $300 for a corded model so for me to jump up to $450 was a stretch of faith. Another reviewer stated she was hearing impaired and these were game changers. Her review sold me. I’m here to sell anyone else that is hearing impaired and has the coin and an IPhone to pair with it. 1. The noise cancelling is better than 35 DB of safety earmuffs I wear for loud noises. Don’t get me wrong about earmuffs. True ear muffs don’t let sound in and also for say shooting a bullet, the pressure wave it creates. Loud riveting is 120db without the pressure wave so it subtly wrecks your hearing over time. 2. It pairs with iphone and iPad simultaneously and when doing so won’t cause either to drop out or any other noises. 3. Comfortable all day 12 hours or more comfortable. The cheaper bluetooths I used have vinyl earmuffs so sweat breaks down the threads and I’m replacing the ear pads every 3-6 month. These Pro max ones are real nice. Apple foam quality. 4. Charges really fast, was at 50% and plugged in and in 20 mins was at 95%. 5. Lightning charger on these now 2020 models . 6 loved them so much that after using a these black ones at work, bought a blue pair for home. If Apple makes hearing aides that are true medical devices I’d say they would crush and own the market. These are that good with their technology. I’m adding that after about a month of using them I finally got around to playing with Logic Pro for IPad. These headphones have a noise cancelling feature that is unmatched. I was blown away with how they actually worked with replacing my IPAD microphone to block out the noise of my gas furnace ( i was arms length away and the burner and fan kicked on) and I recorded a voice track started it with noise cancelling off and was just speaking. Turned the noise cancelling on mid track while speaking and the fan and motor noise nearly disappeared. I don’t know enough of editing to reduce it to nothing but WOW. That’s amazing. I guess I might have to actually read the instructions on answering my phone with them on and seeing how well my voice transmits to others, I never use the headphones to take calls as I want the voice in my one good ear so I grab my phone and switch to it to answer a call. So yeah the noise cancelling is pro level quality IMHO.",

			"title": "Seamless integration with iOS devices (EDIT: but get the extra warranty)",
			"body": "There are certainly cheaper headphones with equivalent sound quality, but these are well-constructed, comfortable for extended wear, have streamlined physical controls which are satisfying to use, and work hand in glove with an iPhone- it doesn't even shut off completely, it just senses when it's off your ears, and pauses playback. Removing this one layer of friction means I'm more likely to take the headphones off when I want to give my ears a breather, and the phone goes back to using its internal speaker while I catch up on email or whatever, and back into the music/podcasts just by putting the phones on. The earpads, held in place by magnets, are secure, but detach without a struggle for cleaning, and their texture is sufficiently breathable and spacious to make for long listening sessions with better overall comfort than most, IMO. L and R channels are marked by a pattern sewn inside the ear cups- a little hard to see, as it's a similar color, but easy to tell in the dark if you remember that the controls are all on the right channel. And they give you a clickable knob for volume and basic track controls, similar in feel to the crown for the Apple Watch, just on a bigger scale. The other control, a button which toggles the transparency of the noise cancellation, is immensely handy, and allows you to converse with people and clearly hear others without having to shift the phones off your ears. NC reduces even a screaming vacuum cleaner to a muted hum. The spatial audio, for apps that support it, can be a little uncanny at first, and familiar to Airpod Pro users- it does feel like the audio is coming right out of the phone, rather than the sound being piped into your ears. The default carrying case has taken criticism for only covering the cans and not providing much protection, but I kind of like it for the portability- it packs up like a little handbag, and the headstrap becomes a handle. I might buy a third party box if I ever need to pack it for a long flight, but this is fine for my daily needs. When the cans are folded for storage, the metal shells kind of clack together without the case, and is definitely in keeping with Apple's design philosophy of charging end users a lot of money for a product which demands additional accessories just to keep it from denting and scratching.\nThere is no traditional headphone jack on the the thing, and it doesn't look like there's even a way to connect it with an adapter, which is unfortunate and should be a dealbreaker if you need that. I just need the Bluetooth, though, and the supported BT 5.0 sounds fine to my ears.\nThere is an option to help locate the phones with Find My, though it will only show where they were last connected to your phone, and it even allows you to play a locator noise through the speakers, so you can hear them in a relatively quiet space from about 8 feet away. What would really have been cool is if they incorporated an AirTag in their design, because at about $500, I live with the uncomfortable possibility of them being stolen if I turn my back.\nIn short, they are comfortable, they are expensive, they sound great, but if you want skull-rattling bass, there are better options. They'll work with any Bluetooth-enabled source, though you'll probably only feel their full value if you intend to use them with Apple products, and if I do ever lose them, I'll be ordering a new pair the next day.\n(Added 7/31)\nAbout a month ago, I started hearing some weird distortion, then one day, six months from purchase, they just refused to sync. I don’t know exactly what the cause was, but I do wear them in hot summer weather and was surprised to find that some sweat can build up behind the ear cushions, so maybe that’s the culprit? I dunno. They’re the only Apple product I have with the AppleCare+ coverage, and replacement was quick and painless, so I consider that money well spent.\nAnyway, nobody said these things were waterproof, which is why I was so careful with them. I still wear them outdoors, but now I pull the ear cushions off every few hours to see if any water has built up inside the cups. Gross.\nI also toss them in a baby bottle sterilizer at the end of the day. Nobody should have to deal with manky earmuffs!",

			"title": "Great head phones - updated review",
			"body": "These headphones connect seamlessly between Apple devices uncle my Apple pros. The sound quality is amazing. Love these head phones and when talking on the phone you sound more clear. The noise cancellation works very good and they’re not to heavy at all surprisingly they are very light weight. I hear a lot of people saying they are too tight but they are a comfortable fit and I have a lot of hair and wear a head covering and they feel very nice over the ears. This came with charging cord and the case. Highly recommend these headphones\n\nUPDATE-\nI have now had these head phones for a couple weeks and they have now the sound has started to go out randomly throughout watching a 10 minute video/or phone call. They sometimes the sound breakups up and lags for a few seconds then goes back to normal. So it’s now not worth the money at all! You can’t listen to anything for 5+ minutes without the sound going in and out or it breaking up and glitching. I have tried to reset them and that hasn’t worked. To be this expensive they should’ve worked for a very long time with no issues and it’s only been 16 days. Waste of money and I can’t return because the window closed on 2/26 I ordered these on 2/7 and received them 2/11. I would NOT recommend these!\n\nUpdate!! Apple has showed me how to reset the headphones! Yay! They work perfectly now and I have had no issues since.",

			"title": "ULTIMATE LISTENING EXPERIENCE",
			"body": "After I perused the specs and got over the sticker shock of the price tag, I thought, “These might be worth the investment for me.” I have high-end hearing loss, and because of that, most speakers, earbuds, and headphones don’t do much for me. I have an especially hard time hearing dialogue on our TV unless the sound is being pumped through our HomePods. That is what caused me to pause and really consider the purchase. “What if the AirPods Max is like putting HomePods on your ears?” That was worth it to me.\n\nAfter setup was completed, I put the headphones on my ears and heard the first sounds through the AirPods Max. It was a Christmas song that I had heard dozens of times before. The sound was so rich, deep, and clear that it was like I was hearing the song for the first time. “Ok, there is no way these sound this good.” At that moment, Robyn, my fiance, walked into the room and said, “So, are they like having HomePods attached to your ears?” All I could do was nod yes. She gave me a look and I handed them over to her. She put the headphones on her ears and scrolled through my library until she found something she wanted to play. She then said she had to have a pair.\n\nWhen I test headphones, I have a few go-to songs I like to try out so that I can get an idea of the listening experience of the headphones from every angle. The songs are pulled from a variety of genres including soundtracks, rock, grunge, punk, classical, and even a bit of rap. The AirPods Max does an incredibly nice job with all of them. The headphones keep a nice, deep bass sound while protecting the integrity of the rest of the track. I also found that vocals are crisp as well and I really love that as I turn up the volume, that I don’t get any distortion. That’s not been the case with other headphones I’ve used.\n\nOverall, I’ve been impressed with all the features of the AirPods Max. Here’s a brief rundown of my thoughts on the main features of the headphones.\n\nActive Noise Canceling (ANC): Until I used the AirPods Max, the ANC on the Sony headphones was the best I’ve ever used. I took the Sony headphones on a flight a few years back and never heard the airplane’s engine noise. Therefore, I’ve always regarded the ANC on the Sony MDR-1000X as the ‘best’. While I haven’t taken the AirPods Max on a plane yet, I can say that it deadens ambient noises like dogs barking, vacuums, and TVs that are left on in the background.\n\nMesh Headband: I love the look of the headband. I think it looks very clean and it accentuates the lines of the AirPods Max. The design is right up my alley.\n\nWeight: I’ve heard some people say that the weight of the headphones is an issue for them. I have noticed that they feel a bit heavier than other headphones I’ve used, but the weight seems evenly distributed to me and so it doesn’t bother me. I’ve worn the headphones for several hours at a time and have not had any issues with headaches or soreness.\n\nButtons: I am a big fan of the buttons. This is odd for me to say since I never thought I would be a proponent of moving to analog from digital, but Apple did a nice job of blending in the Digital Crown and the ANC button.\n\nSmart Case: This is one thing I would have reconsidered if I were designing the AirPods Max — the Smart Case. I really consider it more of a ‘sleeve’ than a case because — well, that’s what it is. The sleeve is made with a single piece of what seems to be polyurethane material and utilizes magnets for the closure. While the sleeve does protect the metal earpieces of the headphones from getting scratched up, for the most part, it doesn’t protect the headband and there is even a cut out on the bottom that leaves the headphones exposed to the elements and potential damage. I also noticed that when I take the headphones out of the sleeve that the AirPods clink together. The only way I’ve been able to stop that from happening is if I physically place my hand there.\n\nEven though there might be a few minor things I would like to see improved about the AirPods Max, I’m absolutely thrilled with them. They are far superior to any other listening experience I’ve had and think that their price tag is worth the investment. Even though the cost is prohibitive for many, if you want the ultimate listening experience, I can’t recommend the AirPods Max enough.",

			"title": "As a complete package, well worth $550 - UPDATE",
			"body": "These are my favorite headphones. When you account for the sound quality, noise cancellation, convenience, comfort and the quality of the build, it makes the price more palatable.\n\nThat said, there's no denying that they are expensive. At the same time, they pretty much reside in their own category of headphones. You can easily get better sounding headphones for less than $200 - but those are wired and lack active noise cancelling. You can shop around other Bluetooth headphones with ANC (XM4, QCII35, 700 etc…) but those don't sound as good. Though they certainly don't sound bad and they're a couple of Benjamins cheaper. I firmly believe the Max's ANC is also better than all the previously mentioned gear, though not by much when compared to the XM4s. One very nice thing about the AirPods Max is the ANC causes no hiss at all, not even a little.\n\nBut there's just no comparison when you compare the build and comfort. Other Bluetooth ANC headphones feel cheap. Once you handle the faux leather and creaky plastic parts you understand why they're much less expensive. The cloth and foam ear pads on the Max are nearly perfect. They form a good seal, even with glasses, and they’re comfortable for long listening sessions. The aluminum and stainless steel parts feel both durable and even luxurious. The mesh headband distributes the Max's substantial weight very evenly. Moreover, everything is modular and repairable on the Max. The circuit boards, batteries, cups, pads, the headband itself - all disassemble with relative ease so your purchase may just last for decades.\n\nMuch has been made of the Max’s weight. In my experience, it’s a non issue. Lounging in the house, washing dishes, sitting at the computer - the weight is fine. BUT, the clamping force is another matter. These things firmly squeeze your head. Initially, I thought I was going to have to return them. Having used them for a couple weeks, they’ve loosened significantly. Possibly, I’ve also acclimated to them.\n\nTransparency mode is amazing. Without doubt, it’s the best implementation I’ve heard. I’ve yet to try out Spacial Audio because until it works with my TV, it’s a gimmick that I don’t care about. I don’t watch movies on my iPhone or even iPad. If you do, you may feel differently.\n\nI do wish I could use them to block out sounds without playing music or white noise. But when not playing audio, the ANC causes too much pressure on my eardrums.\n\nI also wish there were an accompanying App that enabled more intuitive EQ or control of other settings: like perhaps degrees of ANC or better monitoring of battery life and standby. This seems like an oversight on Apple’s part.\n\nYes, the case isn’t much of a case and it is annoying that they don’t include a cable for wired listening. But those are small things and do not detract from the sound quality, convenience and materials of the headphones themselves.\n\nThe ear pads do make my ears warm in my usage. I don’t see how any closed back headphone with a decent seal wouldn’t make one’s ears warm. That said, the warmth doesn’t bother me at all and I don’t feel that they’re uncomfortably hot.\n\nRecently, there have been many reports of condensation and/or sweat accumulating beneath the ear pads on the plastic housing that protects the drivers. Though I don’t doubt these accounts, I have yet to have it happen. After using the AirPods Max for three to four hours, at my desk and around the house, they’re as dry as can be. I don’t know what combination of temperature, humidity, body heat and time causes moisture to appear. All I can suggest is that if you purchase the AirPods Max, try and reproduce the issue with your normal usage. Hopefully, it will be a non issue for you as well.\n\nIf you own a couple of Apple devices, say a Mac and an iPhone, the Max’s convenience makes them even more compelling. Normal Bluetooth pairing can be mildly annoying or, depending on your devices, VERY frustrating. There’s no such hassle with the AirPods Max. They just connect. They just switch. They just work.\n\nIf you’re cross shopping, there are a couple of Bluetooth headphones that might sound slightly better, but they lack ANC. There are many, many headphones that are both cheaper and sound better, but they are wired and lack ANC. The AirPods Max really are in a different class compared to the $350 range of Bluetooth ANC headphones the market has become used to.\n\nIn my opinion, these should not be compared with lesser ANC BT headphones but with the BO H95s. Though I've never owned the H95s, I have held, listened to and envied them. They’re amazing. But they’re also $800 and the ANC is not as advanced. In comparison, the AirPods Max are a bargain, even if they don’t sound quite as nice as the H95s - though they are very close.\n\nI’m very pleased with the AirPods Max. As a complete package, I’m not aware of any other headphones, at any price, that are competitive.\n\n*UPDATE*\nThis morning I shoveled snow for a little over an hour while wearing the AirPods Max. Admittedly, my understanding of atmospheric physics is pretty low, but I figured my very warm head combined with freezing temperatures affecting the aluminum would likely induce some condensation. But, after shoveling, they were as dry as can be. Again, I'm not casting doubt on the many reports of moisture below the ear pads, but I can't reproduce the effect.",

			"body": "Lets start from what everyone wants to know first.\n\nPros:\n1. Holy mother goose, the sound quality is like nothing i have ever heard, it’s Fantastic, Surround sound with everything it connects to\n2. The build quality is far superior to every headset i have ever used. I have had BOSE, JaBra, Sony, and this headset blows them away. IT is all metal save the ear cups and head band thingy. The headset is made out of a single carved out air craft aluminum .\n3. COMFORTABLE , i wore these for 7 hours straight and never had any issues of being too tight, and despite what other reviewers have said, they dont feel heavy on my head at all. Nor does it heat up around your ears.\n3. Battery life. I have not charged them yet and after 20 hours I still dont have to charge them, they are at 30%\n4. The controls are perfect. Rather than mess with the touch type , the volume is a small well placed knob on the right that adjust the sound volume and pause and other functions i still haven’t explored.\n5. Noise Cancellation, OMG, you wouldn’t believe the sound quality of noise cancellation, I went to the flight line at the army base near me, (yes I’m a vet) and was by one of the blackhawks talking to my friend. They started up the Blackhawk, and i called someone and they couldn’t hear it at all. You can hear you own voice like normal rather than the muffled sound you usually get with Bluetooth and noice cancelation, A ++++++\n6. Connection. Everyone of my apple devices automatically paired with out me even prompting. It was completely seamless. I can with between my Mac Mini, IPhone 11, and iPad with no problems. In fact i can connect to any device and go a lot further than that standard 30 ft. I have a quarter acre and i can go anywhere around my house and not lose the signal\n\nCONS: Oh boy here we go\n\n1. The case is stupid, when i say stupid it looks like your carrying a purse around, IT DOES NOT protect the headset. There are cases on amazon made for the IPod Max, that will put it to sleep when you put them in.\nThere is no way to turn them off at all. When you leave them out they go into low power mode after 15 minutes. Or you can put them in the case it came with and they go to sleep.\n2; No brick, for $550 you would think they would include a charging brick but all they give you is a Lighting cable that does NOT have a standard usb connection on one end.\n\nThe cons are few and mostly just trivial things and certainly not a deal breaker. These headphones are so amazing its worth every penny and would last you.a lifetime.\nI see reviews complaining about the weight. Really? These things are NOT that heavy, In fact every expensive head phones ive used make your ears sweat, they flake, and always feels tight.\nYOu dont even notice these headphones after awhile.\nI realize they are expensive but you get what you pay for. And in this case you are getting probably the best headphones you could ever imagine that will not fall apart, feel uncomfortable and give you an amazing sound quality in all areas.\nNo , I’m not paid for this, no, i am not biased about Apple these simply blow away all the other super expensive headphones",

			"title": "Excellent headphones, made in the typical \"first draft\" Apple way",
			"body": "Full disclosure: I purchased these headphones back in April 2021 and gave them some break-in time (until June 2021) before I reviewed them, so this is my experience of having them for more than 90 Days.\n\nI owned a pair of Beats Studio Wireless 2's for about 4 years, and they were a useable set of cans. They had some pretty smart wired connections, good battery life, and were rather comfy to wear... but their wireless connections were a nightmare, the integrated Mic awful, and the noise-canceling mediocre. I was looking for a change, and being a consumer of Apple Products and with the generally good reviews I had seen for the Airpod Max, I decided to take the (kind of) expensive plunge. And honestly, I was not disappointed.\n\nAs with any good review, we'll break it down into the Pros & Cons and explore both.\n\nBUILD QUALITY/DESIGN\n\nPROS:\n\nThe build quality on these headphones is nothing short of phenomenal. They are made of Metal and some nylon or rubber here and there (for the headband and earcup padding) and they feel VERY SOLID. The piston style adjustments on the headband always feel super tight and mechanical (still even months after using them). The earcups are always tight on my head, allowing the headphones to clamp down on my ears and prevent noise leakage. The Earcups are built out of what looks to be a rubberized polycarbonate and padded mesh fabric and are held in by MAGNETS, making them easy to replace if they get soiled or if you want a different color.\n\nAlso, found out after the fact, the headband is ALSO replaceable if you want a different color later on down the line. The metal the speaker boxes are made from are the standard matte Apple aluminum, and the control buttons on the right speaker box are on par with the dials and buttons included on their Apple Watches (in fact, I'm pretty sure they're the same buttons, just \"upsized\" in the CAD program when making this device). It all feels very expensive and well built, and even 100+ days after initial use, still feels \"brand new\" and solid.\n\nCONS:\n\nWhereas I love the build quality, there are some pretty glaring design flaws and comfort issues that come along with this first outing from Apple.\n\nFirst, whereas the headphones still fit like they were brand new, I'd hope for some relief on the hard clamping aspect present in them. When I first wore them, I was finding the clamping done by the headphones very tight and threatening to give me a headache if I wore them too long since it was like a vise on my head. This has lessened slightly over time, but it is still very tight. I don't know of a fix for this outside of constant wear to try and get them to bend a flex to a less tight shape on my dome, but so far they still hurt a bit when wearing them for an extended time.\n\nSecond, even though I like the good piston mechanics on the ear height adjustment with the headband since it takes some force to properly adjust them, sometimes you have to grip on the speaker boxes and pull downwards on them while pushing upwards on the headband with your cranium to get them to adjust to your liking. This wouldn't be an issue if the dial and button were on the bottom of the headphones, but since they're on the top of the right speaker box, it is notoriously difficult to adjust them on your head and not accidentally press one of the buttons, causing playback or the headphones to go into pair mode (which happens if you hold down the buttons for too long). You'd think, \"oh, just grab the sides of the speaker boxes\", which makes sense, however as I stated they are made of Apple's standard aluminum, and to add to that the edges are very rounded, so getting a grip on the side of the headphone speaker boxes is difficult at best.\n\nSOUND\n\nPROS: The sound quality on these is an absolute beast, and it's by far the best pair of headphones I've ever used. The audio is clear, and you can hear highs, lows, and everything in between. However, I will be the first to admit, while I am musically inclined and love listening to audio, I'm by no means an Audiophile or claim to be able to hear what types of sounds are being emitted cleanly and loudly, and which aren't. I usually can if I have good reference, but as these are the best headphones I've ever owned, so they become the new baseline. Also, the built in noise canceling is the best in the business right now, and is definitely better than its closest competitor. The reason why it is so good is due to the multiple microphones established in the soundbox housing, which not only work EXTREMELY well for the ANC, but also for phone calls. The phone calls made from these headphones are nearly studio mic grade in how they sound, and are much better than most things included on computers or competitor headphones nowadays.\n\nCONS: Though I am not an audiophile, there is something that I can tell— when there is killer bass and when there isn't. And to my ears, these don't have a superheavy bass that will rattle your fillings, which is *fine*, but I thought there would simply be *more* bass in the audio. The bass may be enough for most music, and what it has is ok, but nothing akin to the huge bass I was *expecting*. The nice thing is that if you delve into the Accessibility Settings for your Apple product, you can set an audio profile for the headphones so it'll enhance the audio based on how well you hear (so already, this enhancement is *proprietary*; not a big deal for me as I own nothing but Apple devices, but YMMV).\n\nEASE OF USE/ACCESSORIES\n\nPROS: If using Apple products, the handoff of the headphones to the other devices works really, really well and hasn't needed to be paired more than once to each device it is used on. The pairing process is nicely simple if it does go wonky, and doesn't have nearly as many issues as other BT that gets locked into a single device. The equipment/accessories that it comes with are acceptable (charging lightning cable, bra-esque \"case\"). The stop/start/volume dial is very responsive and easy to click using the same click sequence that Airpod Pros have used for a while (Double click to advance, triple-click to go back, quad click, etc...). If you take them off your head, the headphones have a similar light sensor that other Airpods have to determine if they're in your ears or not, and will halt the music accordingly or start playing if they recognize they're back in place on your head. The lightning cable to charge the headphones is embedded in the base of the right-hand speaker box, and charges using the same style cable that your iPhone and old Airpods do, so you should already have at least one cable for it if you own Apple products.\n\nCONS: Hooo boy, ok. So with any early adopter technology, there's always going to be some bugs that need working out, or some design flaw that (where not crippling) makes the headphones more of a chore and less fun to use. This may be our longest section, but please take these with a grain of salt— none of these are dealbreakers for *me*, but since I'm not you, YMMV. Here are the issues I found in no particular order, but NEED to be discussed as I've often seen them glossed over elsewhere—\n\n- Analogue Connection. There is no direct analogue connection with these headphones. As most audiophioles claim, digital (especially wireless digital) will never be an acceptable connection replacement for analogue. And most high-grade cans have some sort of analog 3.5mm jack that can be plugged into a normal headphone port that will allow you to use these headphones with devices that don't transmit via BT, like a Record Player, or high-end sound system. The Airpods Max unfortunately have no such analogue connection. \"But!\" you may exclaim, \"You can always use the Lightning port and plugin a Lightning to 3.5mm converter cable!\" This is true... to an extent. First off, to get that feature to work, you need to get a SPECIFIC cable— Apple's Lighting to 3.5mm cable. The reason? Because that cable, and seemingly ONLY that cable, is BI-DIRECTIONAL. This means that no matter what end you plug your source into, that cable will translate the audio both ways. Most to all third-party cables (that I was able to find in my research) are like an annoying 13-year-old listening to music in 2011: all they play is ONE DIRECTION. Also, to top off the annoyance, when you DO use the Apple Cable, it takes the analogue source, transfers it to the headphones, whose signal is then converted to digital. Automatically, mandatorily, every time. This may be a problem for some people who demand their Analogue output to be heard in its original analogue glory. Also, the Apple cable that you HAVE to use is super cheap feeling and thin, instead of the normal thick or braided casing most headphone cables use. Did I mention that Apple also DOES NOT include this cable with the headphones? It's extra. Like about $30-$40 extra. So you may be better off with another set of headphones if you want a good, wired, analogue signal.\n\n- The \"Case\". I feel like the case that is included with these headphones will go down in history alongside the 1998 iMac USB Puck mouse, the Apple Newton, and the Magic Mouse Lightning port as one of their more GLORIOUSLY STUPID design decisions. The \"case\" is made of what I can assume is leather, but for a set of ~$550 headphones, that's about the only \"premium\" feature they boast. There is minimal padding. There supposedly is a magnet included in the area where the headphone edges touch that triggers an internal reed switch to put the cans in standby mode. Half the \"case\" is exposed to the elements and doesn't fully cover the electronics, so it isn't ideal as something to protect from inclement weather. And lastly, and most egregious, is that there is no way to use the case to carry around the headphones or attach them to anything— no belt clip or loop, no hanging clip, nothing. So believe me when I say that you're gonna need a case for these things if they're ever gonna leave your home, and it's almost imperative if you live in a place with inclement weather. I bought a full zip case that has a built-in magnet for the reed switch, has a few pockets for cables, and is very padded. It was worth the cost to make sure that my headphones that cost *half a thousand dollars* stay safe. Apple's lack of protection has not only garnered users' ire, but made the Airpod Max case into little more than a joke, and I really can't see a counterargument to either of those things.\n\n- Lack of Lossless audio on their own products. So as many know, Apple has just announced that it will have lossless audio on its Apple Music platform soon, which is a boon to audiophiles everywhere. But in everything I have read about it, they always have the caveat that the lossless audio currently doesn't work with the Airpod Max headphones. Even if you buy the bi-directional cable from Apple. And there has been no \"we plan to support it soon\" soundbite, or \"we will be updating the Airpod Max firmware to be compatible in XXX of 202X\". So, if that is super important for you, just know it may not be supported on this model of Airpods Max, possibly at all (Apple is notorious in doing this, and will just release it in the next version). So if it is released eventually, I wouldn't expect it on this model, and you'll have to plunk down another half a thousand bucks to get a set that will work with the feature.\n\nWRAP UP/FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nIn the end, I'm really pleased with these headphones. They are some of the finest pieces of audio equipment that I have ever owned, and I love all the premium features they included. Certain areas leave something to be desired on them, but they are niggling feature issues or design kinks that will be worked out later. I am hopeful that these headphones will stay the same for a few revisions and the firmware/software will evolve to support more features, as well as the accessories (and third-party solutions) to be able to work more universally with non-Apple products or be more robust in their construction. To be fair, for a first draft Apple product, they are the accessory that I've had the least amount hassle with.\n\nAll in all, I highly enjoy and recommend these headphones, and if you are an Apple Fan and budding audiophile, I believe you will too. Let's just hope that Apple keeps improving these models to make them feel like they were worth the ~$550 price point.",

Granted I can't speak to how they match up to the newer Bose QC 700 but being an Apple person, these headphones tightly integrate into the Apple ecosystem so well. Perhaps my biggest complaint about the Bose QC headphone line was Bose's sub-optimal app and switching between devices. The AirPods Max just work with limited user interaction across all Apple devices.\n\nI've been using them seamlessly with my iPhone, iPad, Mac Studio, and AppleTV. The AppleTV experience essentially equates to not needing a high-end surround system (which I also have Bose for). The acoustics and bass when watching movies is stunning.

I think that these headphones are among the best I have ever tried and this includes the Sony WH-1000XM5 which I just purchased a few days ago.\nThe only gripe I have about the Airpods Max is that you cannot turn it off. You have to put the headphones in their smart case in order to \"shut them down\". Even then they do not turn completely, they just go into a very low power consumption. Another is changing the EQ settings or changing any settings except volume and noise cancellation.\nI would not have bought these if they were still at the same original price of $549.00.\nHowever, the reduction in price was enough to try them out.\nI'm glad that I did.",

			"title": "HAD HIGH HOPES BUT GOT THE HIGH HAT!",
			"body": "Well, I was having difficulty deciding after spending hours each of several days doing research. Most reviewers chose the Sony XM4 because of its much lower price, less weight and proven comfort and reliability. Of course that wasn’t good enough for me because I thought I was a little more audoholic than many so I needed to make a more insightful discovery.\n\nI had a Sennheiser several decades ago that was nothing more than a small piece of foam over a small driver and wired of course. It sounded awesome believe it or not so I moved on over to the Sennheiser Momentum 300 which most reviewers rated at or near the top in sound quality and build. It was marked down for modest noise reduction capability and a weight of 300 grams lying in between the Sony at 245 grams and the APMax at 385. Sony is plastic, Apple is metal and fiber and the Momentum is metal and real leather on the ear pads and headband. Apple Earphones are new age sexy, Sennheiser Momentum 300 are retro cool and Sony let’s call modern but plain. Price wise Sony is no higher than $348, Sennheiser is available for $330 down from $400 at introduction in 2019 or so and Apple is $550.\n\nApple does Apple and I have discovered first hand how brutal they are about forcing you to do what they want. If you try to do anything other than pair them with your iPhone or iPad you will meet roadblocks. They only offer music at 48 kilobits per second so that is all they allow you to listen to in their headphones. If you try to hook up to a device with a higher bit rate it will be reduced before it passes through to your headphones. You can theoretically pay $35 for a special little wire that allows you to connect to a device that would otherwise allow you to plug into a receiver. You can only get it from Apple and even then the 3.5 mmonnection won’t fit into receivers because they take a larger jack which is 6.35.\n\nSo while they sell adapters that will fit the bill they aren’t Apple approved. In short they don’t just want you to buy and use all their equipment. They force you to use their other products to use the headphones successfully. The weight of the Air Pods Max coupled with what they call clamping force makes them very uncomfortable to wear and don’t even think about exercising or running in them. They will bounce around as you move and I began to feel strain and stress from the fit within ten minutes. Sure, I bought them to entertain myself on long walks but I don’t know where I would put them for the walk home when they are too heavy to wear. You cannot hang them around your neck without choking yourself and then there is the bra/purse like carrier if you was to carry that. Won’t fold in on itself like many of most headphones.\n\nNo matter how sexy it looks or how cool it makes you feel to be envied for your coolness the grimace on your face after an hour with these on your head will not attract anyone. I really wanted these as I was telling myself they must have the best sound quality and that is what I am all about. Still if I don’t like wearing them the music doesn’t help much and I am left with hoping a really cool person or persons will see that I am cool also. I don’t hate Apple and I have an IPhone 10max and an iPad(I bought my first one in April 2010 when the first one was introduced and was the very first truly friendly computer like device) and a MacBook Pro which I won’t replace.\n\nWith these headphones they have gone too far with the silly and unnecessary allegiance to Apple required to use it easily. You can search for hours online to find workarounds but half or more of what people suggest doesn’t work. Meanwhile Apple knows all of this and basically gives us the old high hat if we are willing to buy products that compel us to buy only their other products to make them work. Connecting instantly to my iPhone when picked up or put on rather than having to use a typical Bluetooth prompt to accept a connection is not worth enslaving myself just to show aluminum on my ears.\n\nI am boxing these up even though they arrived earlier today. I bought them from Amazon because of their stellar return policy and I recommend you do the same if you want to try these. If I kept them I would be doing what many who read my review will do and that is defend and rationalize my choice. That is what human beings do. So if Apple product allegiances are important to you after spending this amount of money on top of all the other products you have bought from them feel free to put it on blast. I know this is a lot of money to spend for many if not most people and I wanted to write something for folks who haven’t had time to do a lot of research and are at a decision point.\n\nI am torn between the Sony XM4(leaving me light headed and looking average) and the Sennheiser Momentum 300(xciting to listen to but making me look my retro like my age). If you want to check out online reviews you will find that deciding who to listen to and trust is every bit as difficult as making your headphone choice. I don’t know who receives what in the way of free products to use or resell or even monetary compensation which might disappear with too much honesty. All I can do is tell you what I think and let you take it into consideration if helpful.\n\nI don’t care about corporations especially large ones as they take care of themselves just fine. I have learned\nthat there are people who are loyal to and defend corporations and don’t like others criticizing them or their products. In my own life I find that my weakest point is often my best point pushed too far. I think the exuberance for these Air Max headphones and Apples marketing games has likely reached that place with these headphones. Who knows? Maybe I will update my review once I try the Sony or the Sennheiser or both. For now I will be happy to merely take a heavy load off my head!",

			"body": "I really loved these headphones. The sound quality and noise cancellation were terrific for me. I also love the convenience of the digital crown. Although most complain about the case, I LOVE it. It's like a cute little purse! There is one issue that made me return this product. The multipoint connection seemed to be for Apple products only.\n\nFor example, my headphones switched seamlessly from my iPhone to my iPad. However, when I connected my Samsung TV to the headphones, I could hear the TV through them, but I had to reconnect the headphones to my iPhone or iPad after doing so. So, while watching the TV or playing a game, I am not getting any phone calls or text notifications through the headphones because they have disconnected for me to play the TV. I also cannot accept any calls while watching the TV. I have to go back into my iPhone's Bluetooth devices and reconnect the headphones to the iPhone in order to have a conversation through the headphones. This is not a true multipoint connection. The headphones would have been perfect if Apple had not had this error.\n\nI ended up going with a pair of Bose QC Ultras out of necessity. These headphones allow me to watch the TV/game through the headphones, and when someone calls me, it quiets the TV and announces the call. This is a true multipoint connection because all points stay connected and interact with each other. I also own much cheaper Skullcandy Crushers and Evos, which have a true multipoint connection.\n\nThis issue may not be a deal breaker for most, but it was for me. After saving for these headphones for nearly eight months, I was past excited to buy them. The simple joy of unboxing an Apple product is worth its weight in gold. When I realized that these costly headphones did not have a true multipoint connection aside from their Apple branded products, I wanted to slap my own face with a powdered hand! Unbelievable!",

It's not an audiophile headphone, but will most definitely compete with any other ANC headphone out there.

When listening to HBO's \"The Pacific\", or Netflix's \"Masters of the Air\", the soundstage elicits an immaculate impression of the battlefront. The incredible representation of mortars, sub-machine guns, and crossfire makes you believe you are actually on the front line. Terrifyingly realistic. Mids and high's require absolutely no translation. Completely natural.

			"title": "Great headphones",
			"body": "I have many sets of headphones, some very nice ones, and these stand alone in terms of being something different - there is so much tech jammed into these, it makes them very different than anything else on the market.\n\nSound - Sound quality on these is very good, very clean. Personally I'd like a lot more bass, but even someone who isn't a basshead would still probably like more bass. They're not weak or anything on the low end side, and booming bass is there, it's just too much in the background for my tastes. If stupid iOS just gave you an EQ, you could probably easily fix this, and some of the sound profiles you do get can hep, but for the love of everything, just give me a stupid EQ so I can choose the sound I want. In any case, again, the sound is very good, very clean. I'd say it's pretty easily better than my Bose QC25 but not on-par with my Beyerdynamic DT 990 open backed headphones (which I still think are the best headphones I've heard and I've compared them against sets costing well over $1k). But these headphones are about a lot more than sound, and that's why they go up to 5-stars...\n\nSound Field/Stage - The sound stage on these, the openness of the sound, is amazing for closed back headphones. When you're playing music that supports Apples spatial sound (everything in Apple Music for example) it's incredible, it really feels/sounds natural a lot of the time. I've used other 'virtual surround' garbage, and it's terrible, but whatever Apple is doing, it works. My favorite thing is that you can set your phone in front of you, then walk around, and it sounds like the sound is coming from the direction of the iPhone, so it gives you this incredible sense of space (and it does not hurt the sound quality - for most music it sounds better in my opinion). This is something you really have to experience to understand as I don't know of anyone else that does this - and it's really impressive in person.\n\nNoise Cancelling - Absolutely top notch. Between the good fit of the headphones and the actual tech, you can block out a ton of stuff, they work better than my Bose QC25's, that still were best in class as of a year ago. Also, for the cry babies, I do not notice the pressure effect - it might be there still, but it's not nearly as noticeable as the Bose.\n\nBattery Life - Seems to be excellent. Only downside is it uses an iPhone plug, not USB C. I still have and need an iPhone plug so it's not a huge deal at the moment, but for the future, when it's all USB C, this is going to become a pain.\n\nComfort - It's pretty comfortable. I heard lots of people say these are big and heavy and uncomfortable, and while they are big and heavy, for me at least they're pretty comfortable. Those Beyerdynamic DT 990 are amazingly comfortable, can wear them for hours, that's not the case here. But compared to my Bose QC25, I can wear the AirPods Max for longer without any issues. Still, it's not like the comfort of earbuds, which I can wear all day, but for big over the ear headphones, the Max's are pretty good.\n\nBuild Quality - Top notch in my opinion, make everything else I've ever used, anything else I've ever even tried, feel plasticky and cheap.\n\nWireless - No lag, no drops, works great. I wish they had upped the bandwidth so you could carry stuff like fully uncompressed audio, like blu-ray audio, but probably have to wait for V2 for that. With that said, I've never really noticed anything, everything sounds full with no compression. Obviously that isn't the case, but just saying, I do not notice any negatives as far as wireless goes.\n\nOverall, 5-stars. The sound, with less bass than I'd like and with no EQ in iOS, only gets 4-stars, but the other features make these unique and quite amazing. The spatial sound is what makes these special, and you can't get that with any other over the ear headphones, and it works remarkably well. I think it uses actual head movement for tracking, so it's not just a software gimmick they can do on any other headphones (I think that's the case), but it' something you need to hear in person to appreciate.",

			"body": "Summary: TLDR;\nLove the sound, great comfort on top of head (but a little tight on the side of the head around the ears), awesome for movies (spatial audio is awesome) and music. Excellent ANC. Connection from phone to iPad and back is perfect. However there is water buildup after 3-4 hours underneath the earcups - repeatable when just sitting at my desk at 66-70 degrees. Connection to a MacBook Pro and back to phone is just not as seamless, and it gets lost sometimes. I returned them but tested them extensively for 3 weeks, really wanted to keep them but the water flaw is too concerning at this price to risk it.\n\nDetailed Review:\n\nI’m going to start with the good:\n- spatial audio is really good. Watching the Mandelorian is great - more for the surround sound experience than the more gimmicky thing with turning your head - which is “cool” but adds little to no value. Whereas surround sound - experiencing noises from different sides really helps with the immersion.\n- sound quality is excellent for Bluetooth headphones. I preferred these instead of the XM4. I am not an audiophile but I like good sound and these seemed more balanced. I have $200 wired seinheiser headphones that I might like a tiny bit better for music for what it’s worth.\n- construction build quality is definitely a step up from competitors.\n- connecting to iOS devices is excellent and to a MacBook Pro is good - but not great. More on that later.\n- ANC really good equal pretty much to XM4. I think xm4 is slightly better at some things and these are better cancelling other noises. Overall excellent\n- headband / top of head very comfortable. Much more so than the xm4.\n\nNeutral:\n- lots of people made a big deal about no power off button and talk about it just “draining battery” unless you put it in the case. I tested this a lot, and it seems Apple is accurate when they say it goes to low power mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. Losing about 1% every couple of hours. Essentially losing 5% when left without a case overnight. I’m talking 5-6pm to 8am. However I had an issue where they wouldn’t turn on (only 1 day) with a full battery. Since there is no power button... I removed them form my ears out then back on, I stuffed them in the “smart case” removed them, nothing. I plugged them to the lightning cable to see if the charge light would turn on, and then they immediately started working (battery read 109%, I only plugged them in for 5 seconds). It only happened one day out of 20... but annoying nonetheless.\n- ear pad material is soft but course so moving it side to side hurts my ears. But leaving then on (normal use case) is comfortable.\n\nCons:\n- the “case”. It has a nice material but it doesn’t provide any protection for them at all. Fairly pointless and you can see all the jokes online about it. I don’t think it looks bad, it’s just pointless without any protection. Going to ultra low power mode a day sooner (it still takes like 15 hours or something, not sure why it’s not instant to that power mode).\n- the price. Just a tad too high to swallow, but I had returned the XM4 for various small annoyances to splurged on this hoping it solved the issues - it mostly does but the last 2 points made me return them:\n- connecting to MacBook Pro and iPhone “automatic switching”. I was hoping this would be better than the XM4 (which constantly got stuck on the wrong device and had no way other than turning off Bluetooth to send it back to the laptop). It is better, but it’s not perfect. It’s perfect between iOS devices - going back and forth from phone to iPad is seamless and pretty amazing - much better than anything out there. However once a MacBook is involved it’s a different deal. There is a little prompt at the top right that shows up that you need to click when switching back and forth, but it no always shows up. Sometimes it does, sometimes it switches automatically and sometimes I need to connect the headphones to the MacBook again. I’m still not sure when it does which of them. However removing them from my ears and putting them back on resets it and I’m connected to the MacBook or the prompt shows up for me to click. Overall I’m not sure why they couldn’t make it as seamless as iOS where just clicking pause on one and play on them other switches the connection immediately: there is no awkward prompt or anything. Overall I was disappointed on the instant switching when involving my MacBook Pro. Still works better than the xm4 and Bose 700 that sometimes gets lost in between with no easy reset.\n\nFinally why I returned them - you can see the pictures I attached. I wanted these as primary work headphones (conference calls - which they work great, ANC which works great, easy switching which works very good but not great, and for music and movies which they are excellent).\nHowever the stories online I thought maybe affected few people. The first day I didn’t have any buildup, nor the second or the third. However today after a 4 hour session, I checked and there was enough for me to not be comfortable that these expensive headphones would last the 10 years I was hoping they would.\nIf it weren’t for the water buildup I would probably keep them, they are that good, but this is a deal breaker since Apple does not cover water damage as part of warranty.\nI was simply sitting in my desk, half basement. I didn’t walk or exercise or anything. Temperature was 66 degrees Fahrenheit so fairly cool. The theory online is the metal acts as a heat sink in comparison to the warmth between your ears and earcup area.\nUpdate: I have been able to consistently (daily) repressive the condensation issue. It was not a one time thing. After 3-4 hours every day I get to wipe the inside because there is water. Yeah I returned them.\n\nAnyway I’m not gonna risk holding an expensive paperweight. Too bad because they are great headphones with a fatal flaw.\nI contacted Apple and the just said: “we are aware of the claims and are looking into them”. They are not just claims they are very much real. And you don’t have to wear them for 20 hours - this was only 4 hours.\n\nIf you have a question feel free to ask. I’ve tested these and the xm4s fairly extensively.",

			"title": "Spatial Audio is AMAZING for watching movies, Superb fit & finish, nice neutral sound",
			"body": "After two years of debating, I finally decided to buy the Apple Airpods Max after they dropped the MSRP and found them on sale for the first time. I'm normally a Bose guy and have three pairs of Bose (a regular pair w/O NC but punchier base, an older pair of NC’s, & a pair of NC700 which gI got with my 700 Soundbar, 700 Sub & 700 Surrounds)…\n\nI also own a pair of Sony 1000’s which I bought my Dad or watching Horror movies at night after my Mom has gone to bed at night.\n\nBut the noise cancelling, fit and finish, nice neutral sound and the AMAZING “Spatial Audio” which will play Dolby Atmos while watching movies and videos (nearly all 4k UHD movies on Netflix work w/ dolby Atmos & Spatial Audio on headphones) blow all the others out of the water.\n\nThe case is made out of leather(ish)? material, which is nice, but is almost too minimalistic and won't offer much protection in a fall. Luckily, there are a bunch of cheap hard cases all over the internet for $20 or less which is much cheaper than Apple’s version.\n\nKeep in mind I bought these mostly for watching movies but even if only use them for listening to music these headphones beat the competition all around. If you plan to use these while exercising I’d look somewhere else bc they are quite heavy and if you’re audiophile willing to spend $1,000+ on studio headphones (and the headphone amp & other accessories which usually cost more than the headphones themselves) these will not work as a substitution.\n\nBut so far, I feel these headphones justify the higher price Apple charges even at the original MSRP of $599. A competitor even had a refurbished pair for $360! I plan to sell all but my Bose 700’s to pay for these bc only these two models will allow two pairs of headphones to be used at the same time while watching a movie.. and I take especially good care of my electronics bc Im on a fixed income and each purchase is a major sacrifice.\n\nI haventbhad them long enough to comment on battery life but connected to my iPhone automatically and walked me through the set-up process.

			"title": "Woah",
			"body": "Okay, so let me begin by saying that I am a shameless Apple sheep, and buy most Apple products that come out. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, MacBook Mini, and I'm waiting on a Mac Studio to arrive. But for some reason I've resisted Apple's attempts to make a speaker, and I don't like to wear ear bud style headphones, so never purchased any AirPods. I've even experimented with non-Apple music solutions including Tidal, Amazon and Spotify among others.\n\nBut with the recent price drop, and the fact that I fly a lot, I decided to give these headphones a try. I genuinely thought there was a 80% chance I'd return them, as I currently use the well reviewed Sony MX4s.\n\nThe wow factor of these is unbelievable. Watching a movie or TV show on my iPad is incredible. I listened to the opening sequence to The Blacklist Season 1 Episode 1, which has some good audio. My wife, who is never that impressed with audio took a listen and was blown away.\n\nI got on board with Apple Music, and listened to the lossless music, and also the specially mixed spacial audio. Wow. Wow again. Yeah, I'd pay retail for these.\n\nI think the obvious gripes have been made already. The lightening port was a bad call, but I carry those cables for my iPhone anyway, so no biggie. Although I suspect these headphones will be the last of my devices to still require that plug.\n\nThe case is idiotic, as is the decision to give me no manual control over turning them off. You seriously have to put these things in the horrific case to put them in low power mode, and there is reasonable question as to whether this case would provide any meaningful protection of these expensive headphones.\n\nSpeaking of lunacy, the steps you have to take to coax the device into updating its firmware is also Apple arrogance at its finest. Why I can't have a standby switch or button and an update firmware option is beyond me. And again, I'm a fanboy here.\n\nIt's also pretty sad that the design allows the cans to bang together if not handled carefully, which will surely result in scratches at some point.\n\nOh, and want to listen with a wire, enjoy buying that $35 proprietary cable from Apple. Seriously. This is why people hate Apple.\n\nBut despite these many very reasonable gripes, the bottom line here is that these sound better than every Bose pair I have owned, my Sony MX4s, and several Bang & Olufsen sets I've had. The seamless swiping between Apple products is also pretty sweet. The transparency mode is probably the best on the market too.\n\nThere is no doubt I'd highly recommend them. Be aware of the need to bend a little to Apple's will, in several areas, but know that the pay off is some pretty stunning results. I'm actually looking forward to going back to work on Monday to hear how they do on the plane. Flying to New Orleans, so should be in the air for around 3 hours.\n\n***\n\nUPDATE: Six months later...\n\nSo these are great headphones. Unfortunately, after six months of use, it's hard to justify a five star rating.\n\nBackground noise control is great, transparency mode is amazing, the sound quality is excellent. But, they are heavy, you have to plan your entire business trip packing strategy around lugging these heavy and inconvenient items around. I had to buy a third party case to protect them, and use it with the stupid Apple case. They take up a huge chunk of back pack real estate.\n\nThen, after five months or so, they started randomly disconnecting. More specifically, it seems like the sensor that decides if I am wearing them isn't functioning correctly. So if I scratch my head or move too suddenly, they shut off, disconnect, and then I have to pull out my iPhone or iPad, force them to reconnect, and continue. Given that these are heavy and not particularly comfortable, you find yourself trying to put off scratching an itch, just to avoid the hassle of reconnecting.\n\nMy expectations rise with price, so at over $500, by far the most expensive travel headphones I've ever purchased, I do kind of expect flawless. For all their positives, there are a LOT of negatives, which is such a shame. I imagine that version 2 or 3 will be so cool. And, like a total sucker, I'll probably buy them.\n\nFor now, I'm going to switch to the AirPod Pro 2s, while these headphones are at the Apple Store being repaired. I may even sell them at this point. Such a shame.",

			"title": "Ultra-Picky Review",
			"body": "Take my review with a grain of salt and or from a super picky perspective. These headphones are incredible. From the build quality, the feel, the fit, and the finish, they are worth the hefty price tag. The sound is bold with an open sound stage, medium bass at lower volumes and super punchy full bodied bass at higher volumes. The bass is not overwhelming and adds that “feel” to the music you are listening to without distortion. The issue I have is that these did not meet my expectations. I did not expect something BETTER, but I expected something DIFFERENT. I read reviews and heard feedback from some people I know and I created an expectation of my own as to what to expect with these headphones. Of course with them being Apple, they have to be great, which was true.\nFrom what I expected, the best way I can compare is when you go to an electronics store and see a super high quality QLED 4K LED Ultra HD tv in cinematic mode playing a movie and you can just tell that the scenes in the movie are on a stage or a set and you can see the layers to it, that is kind of what I expected from these headphones. I expected a super dynamic sound stage, I expected to hear each instrument and sound around me instead of layered, and to feel that I was in an open room. But that is what you’d expect from a different type of headphone. This is solely what I thought to expect, but not what I got. The takeaway from that is that my expectations were just different but I was not let down at all. I am returning them and going to do more research on what type of sound I am looking for.\n\nAll in all, if you’re unlike me and my wild mind that doesn’t create images of things before you buy them, you will love these headphones. The aluminum is beautiful, the mesh on the headband feels like a cloud, and the sound and noice cancelling is spectacular. My only true gripe about the design is that when you take them off and want to put them on your neck, the bare aluminum might be uncomfortable on your collar bones. You might want to turn the ear cups and fold them flat, but they fold outward from your body and you have the whole metal body resting in your collar bones. I just wish they would fold in the other way so the ear cushions are resting on your body. And one last bit is since they fold that way, the aluminum ear cups, when folded will clank against each other and can cause scratches over time. Again, this is my extremely picky review on these headphones, but you’re probably a normal person and will love them, so please do buy them. You will not regret it!",

			"body": "I recently got my hands on the Apple AirPods Max, and I must say, they didn't disappoint. The headphones arrived promptly at my doorstep, securely sealed as expected. The initial unboxing experience was nothing short of satisfying, and I was eager to dive into the audio quality.\n\nSpeaking of sound, the AirPods Max offer a solid audio experience. The audio is clear, and the bass is punchy, delivering an enjoyable listening experience. However, I did find myself wanting more in terms of customization. Apple's limited equalization options leave a bit to be desired, as I longed for the ability to fine-tune the sound to match my preferences.\n\nOne noteworthy aspect that slightly underwhelmed me was the exclusive wireless nature of the headphones. While they provide convenience, it becomes apparent that their true potential shines when paired with high-fidelity audio sources. Listening to music with the AirPods Max is a delight, but the wireless limitation can prevent you from fully appreciating the depth of sound they are capable of delivering.\n\nTo make the most of the remarkable sound quality, it's evident that Apple intends for you to immerse yourself in the Apple ecosystem, particularly through their Apple Music service. While other platforms like Spotify and YouTube Music offer good sound, the complete enveloping experience is best achieved when paired with Apple Music.\n\nIn terms of build and design, the AirPods Max exhibit a touch of luxury with their sleek aesthetics. They do carry a tad more weight compared to their leading competitors, but personally, I didn't find it bothersome. However, it's important to note that these headphones are not designed for gym use. The lack of waterproofing and the tendency of the ear cushions to trap heat make them less suitable for intense physical activities.\n\nWhen it comes to noise cancellation, the AirPods Max do a commendable job. While they might not be the absolute best in the market, they effectively filter out a significant portion of external noise, allowing you to enjoy your music without excessive distractions.\n\nIn my conclusion, the Apple AirPods Max provide a well-rounded audio experience that caters to music enthusiasts seeking premium sound quality. While there are some minor drawbacks, such as limited equalization options and the exclusivity of their audio potential, these headphones are a solid choice for those within the Apple ecosystem who prioritize exceptional sound and design.",

You’ll understand once you’ve received your half grand headphones. For the head band theres a silicone band protector here on amazon, j recommend purchasing as well, same for the cushions. Just to keep the device in good shape and lasting longer than it should. Understand your hair, ears and face give off oils, and over time can damage your very expensive headphones. Sound quality 10/10 AMAZING. Noise cancellation 10/10. The ear muffs are metal, i hear a lot of complaints about it being heavy on your head, i didn't have that problem. Fits and feels fine to me. Everything you see in the picture is what comes in the box. I recommend these to anyone, but not everyone loves Apple products. They look sleek and nice to the touch.

			"body": "Play Video\nAs you can see, I have an array of headphones that I use for different reasons. I also love them all for different reasons, but the Apple AirPods Max are the most impressive thing I’ve ever heard music come through.\n\nI wanted them from the day they dropped. Actually, I wanted them from the day they were announced in the Keynote presentation. I couldn’t afford them, because who can? When I got a job eight months ago that came with a generous home office stipend as part of the compensation package, I knew that these headphones would soon be mine.\n\nThe noise cancellation is out of this world. I used to wear Bose Quiet Comforts every single day, and thought that the noise cancellation on those was good. I’m not saying that it wasn’t good, but after experiencing that feature on these headphones, I could never go back. I also absolutely love that with the push of a button, you can switch from noise cancellation to transparency mode, which not only turns noise cancellation off, but uses a group of different microphones to bring the outside world into your headphones, almost like hearing aids. I am hard of hearing, and I really appreciate that feature.\n\nThe headphones are a little heavy, which took some getting used to. My Bose headphones were incredibly light and at times I forgot I was wearing them. You definitely don’t want to accidentally fall asleep with these on, because you will absolutely have a headache when you wake up. That is honestly the only negative thing that I can come up with, however.\n\nI prefer my regular AirPods 3rd generation when I’m cleaning or walking my dog, as well as when I’m outside, but otherwise, these are my go to headphones. The microphone is incredible! All of my colleagues say that I sound super clear in meetings, and when I am FaceTimeing with family or talking to someone that I’m gaming with I’ve only heard the same. I generally use my Kraken Kitty headset for gaming, but I’ve definitely busted out the AirPods Max as well.\n\nObviously, there’s also no ignoring that if you’re already fully immersed in the Apple ecosystem, the convenience that comes with buying these instead of a different brand is undeniable. Being able to switch from your iPhone to your iPad to your MacBook and back to your iPhone during phone calls and while listening to music — seamlessly without having to worry about pairing — is incredibly smooth and enjoyable. It’s also great to be able to see your battery life on your screen. They also pair without issue with devices outside of the Apple ecosystem, like the Nintendo Switch!\n\nI am well aware of the fact that most people can’t just up and decide to buy a set of headphones like this, but if you’ve had them in your cart, or on a wish list for a while, and you have been saving up, but afraid to make the leap, just go ahead and leap! You won’t regret it.",

			"body": "Since I mostly work from home and listen to music when I'm not on the phone I use several bluetooth ear pods including AirPod Pros.\n\nThe Max version has always intrigued me but I have quite a few over ear headphones so until they went on sale there was nothing compelling me to purchase them.\n\nI've had them long enough to break in the drivers to some degree. Yes like most dynamic headphones these need to be broken in for 20 to 50 hours before they can be judged for sound quality.\n\n1. I'm a headphone guy so sound quality is my first priority. This is an excellent headphone. They blow away my bluetooth Sennheisers on sound quality. They even compete with some wired headphones. They may not reach the level of my Grado 325's but they are much more comfortable. My Focal Clears, which incidentally match well with the output voltage of my iPhone, are superior but are much more expensive. And wired. BTW you can't get Lossless audio through Bluetooth so a wired headphone has that advantage. And you can't talk through the Clears. My wired Sennheisers don't really have the output levels to match an iPhone so they are not in the consideration. These have a wide range sonically and reproduce all kinds of music well. And unlike some Beats models they are not bass heavy. I think they work best with Spatial Audio off. iMy only complaint is that the midlevel sound stage is a bit compressed regardless of volume. Apple did their home work in designing these headphones. I'd go so far to say that you will not find another headphone wired or not that has as good as sound for the money.\n\n2. Comfort/Fit. One goes with the other. The head band is comfortable for my large head and does not squeeze my ears. The ear pad material is not what I'd like but it is surprisingly comfortable. Typical of any headphones they are best used without glasses for maximum comfortable. If you use glasses put the pads on your ears with the glasses on for maximum comfort. I do not notice any weight - these are much lighter than most wired headphones. The ear space fits my large ears although ideally a couple of extra mm's would be better.\n\n3. They connect easily once you go through the initial connection procedure. Most importantly they have excellent battery life. They have double or more battery life than Pros. Put them in the case when you are through with them for the day as it is the only way they turn off. You will otherwise lose battery life as they are otherwise constantly scanning for possible bluetooth targets. The case is not great but it works well for being put into a bag or backpack. Generally they do a good job of picking up your voice in telephone or FaceTime mode.\n\n4. They are an excellent value. Usually a substantial discount means that there is a newer model is coming out. My research suggests that is not the case. There is likely to be a newer model of the Pros coming out which explains their greater discount.\n\nI am very pleased with these headphones and I think that you will be equally as pleased.",

The sound quality is outstanding, and they're incredibly comfortable, making them perfect for long flights as someone who travels frequently for work.\n\nHowever, I was slightly disappointed that they don't support conversation awareness or adaptive mode, features that would have been handy. Moreover, the noise cancellation, while good, doesn't seem to match the level of the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which is a bit of a letdown.\n\nThe build quality is excellent, and they fit really well. The battery life is impressive too. But at a price point of $550, I can't help but feel that they're overpriced. If you're an audiophile willing to splurge, these might be for you, but for most, there are more cost-effective alternatives out there.",

I will be honest, I had so much hesitation prior to purchasing these headphones based on some of the reviews. The biggest concerns were all the reviews that mentioned connectivity issues and the condensation issues. I can honestly say, after using these for a solid month, that I have not experienced any of these issues whatsoever. They connect automatically once on my head, and when I am using multiple apple devices, they will switch automatically based on whatever device is playing audio (except my MacBook Pro, but I do not mind manually connecting them. I literally takes two clicks...). The audio quality is probably the best of any headphones that I have ever owned. My favorite features are the immersive seal and the noise cancellation. The design of the headphones allows for your ears to be completely enveloped in sound, and when that seal is combined with noise cancellation, it is like the world around you disappears. I love them. They are pricey, but I have ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS purchasing them. I saved up for them, and they are, in my opinion, worth every. single. penny. I did purchase Applecare+ for an additional 60 dollars. That's a no-brainer, seeing as how expensive these things are. I also bought a thin silicon covering to protect from scratches. All in all, if you have the money, and you love apple products, and you like that premium apple feel, BUY THESE! Totally worth it.\n\nUPDATE:\n2 months in, and they still work great! After a recent update on my Mac, I’ve noticed that the headphones now connect automatically. Hand-off is now seamless with my iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro. A small update, but a good one!",

The point of Noise cancelling premium bluetooth headphones for me was to be able to work around the house, and use some nice headphones instead of earbuds. I have a big head, so I figured the reviews were wrong about the heaviness, but they are. If you bend down, lean one way, move around too much, they'll slide or fall off. This is a deal breaker 1 for me. They are comfortable otherwise, the band and cushions are amazing, but you can't change the weight or looseness on these, only the up and down adjustment.\n2nd dealbreaker - definitely can't make music with these. Which probably isn't an issue for most, but if you wanted to use these time to time with music recording, don't even think about it. There's some weird interference there with the internal makeup of the sound (EQ I think?) and the bluetooth delay.\n\nThat being said, if you love apple, and want to just use these for chilling on the couch wireless or not moving around much, or have a head the size of Joe Rogan or the Rock Dwayne Johnson you should be fine.\n\nThey look awesome, the volume knob and action knob are super helpful, and the sound is good (not great - not a lot of bass, it's true - I didn't even want bass booming in my ears, but you won't hear much regardless, moreso the vocals) and they are super well quality made (durable, steel, materials, etc) so I can't give it lower than 4 stars on that alone, and they will work for most if you aren't needing to be mobile.\n\nNo chance you can use these working out or exercising though.",

In addition, if you have a large head, as do I, the clamping force on your head may be a dealbreaker for you. I have learned to adjust the position on my head to mitigate that. Unlike many headphones, you will spend a little more time adjusting them for comfort. The Sony XM4s are definitely more comfortable.\n\nControls. The two button controls are simple and easy to use which is the same setup on the Apple watch. I prefer this setup to the touch controls on the XM4, which can be hit and miss. You can adjust the direction for volume up or down based on what is more intuitive to you.\n\nSound. The sound is absolutely amazing. Hands down the best I have ever heard. While listening to music is often discussed, not much is said about using them with AppleTV which is actually the primary reason I purchased them. Listening to a movie or TV show through the Airpods Max is simply unbelievable. Spatial audio is a brilliant audio enhancement.\n\nBattery life. I have been able to get the 21 hours they advertise. Battery life is not nearly as robust as the XM4s however. Much has been made about the fact that they can't be turned off. I have not found that to be an issue, although it does force you to put them in the case in order to put them in sleep mode. Noice cancellation is excellent.\n\nMiscellaneous. Yes, the case is ridiculous. I purchased a more viable case for. It does not come with a charging adapter (brick). That was a not a real issue for me. I was far more upset when they shipped iPhone 12s without them. I find them too heavy to for exercising. I use the XM4s for that. I do not use them for business meeting calls (Zoom, etc.), so I have no opinion on that. If you are going to purchase AppleCare, purchase it through Amazon. Adding it with Apple is a hassle if you purchased them from Amazon.\n\nSummary. The construction of the Airpods Max is something to behold. If you are an iPhone, Apple Music, AppleTV user, you will definitely want to consider these. I was on the fence for awhile because of the price, but after using them I have no regrets. I give them 4.5 stars. The weight prevents me from giving it 5 stars.",

			"body": "I will be comparing the APM with the Sony XM4's as I purchased and used both side-by-side.\n\nThe APM have incredible active noise cancellation (tested with airplane white noise on YouTube) and their transparency mode is incredible. I give them the edge on both fronts compared to the Sony's. I also think the handoff between multiple Apple devices is superior to the Sony's which can only pair to two devices at the same time. I also feel there is potential in the magnet APM cups that can be changed as desired. If you don't like the ones that come with the APM you could potentially purchase a 3rd party option of a different material.\n\nI prefer the Sony's for sound quality. You can tweak the EQ to your liking with their app. With the APM you are stuck with their default sound signature or the terrible presets in iOS settings. The default APM sound is good but leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Sony's which literally lets you tweak it to how your ears desire. I am a bass-head and the APM bass simply lacking for rap and pop music (to my ears).\n\nWhile I think the concept of the APM physical controls for volume and track selection is superior to Sony's touch controls for the same, the placement of these buttons on the top of the right cup is baffling. I'm confident most people are like myself and like to adjust their headphones by gripping the top and bottom of their respective ear cups. By doing so you will inevitably press on these buttons. The Sony's have two buttons located on the bottom side edge (on/off and a custom button that by defaults lets you toggle modes). Far better placement.\n\nThe 'smart case' is actually nothing but a sleeve that is rather ridiculous as it's required to properly turn off the headphones entirely. Why Apple opted for no on/off button is beyond me. The APM come with no cable to connect to airplane entertainment systems, no travel case, no ability to fold into a more compact size, and no charging brick. A $550 set of headphones should include a charging brick and nice travel case, don't you think??\n\nThe Sony's meanwhile have all the cables you could possibly need, fold into a compact size, and comes with a lovely hardshell case. It doesn't have a charging brick but it's also far less expensive compared to the APM.\n\nAh yes, price. At retail the APM are $550 and while the Sony's retail for $350, they can often be found brand new for $280, literally half the price.\n\nSo let's recap. APM have amazing ANC, transparency mode, mic for phone calls, the ability to swap out the ear cups, and flawlessly work with multiple Apple products.\n\nThe Sony's allow you to tweak the sound to your liking, are more comfortable by far to wear, an on/off button plus superior button placement, a hardshell case, fold into a compact size, include the necessary cables for travel, and cost half as much as the APM.",

I have used other headphones in the past like Sony and Bose but honestly I didn’t like the white noise sound they’d make, and how frequently frustrating it would be to connect the headphones between various apple devices seamlessly.\n\nThe airpod max are a little overpriced in my opinion. The headphone’s storage case is pretty useless, it offers zero protection to the headphones. It’s not a hard case just a soft one that doesn’t even cover the top band. When I stick these in my bag I’ll actually put them in an old hard camera case because that protects them more than the case apple provided for them.\n\nDespite that though it does a very well job of smoothly connecting to my different apple devices depending on which one I’m using. Almost 2 months in on using it and I’ve never had an issue with them randomly disconnecting or not pairing properly, even with non-apple devices like my gaming PC.\n\nThe noise cancellation is pretty great too, it doesn’t cancel out 100% of the background noises depending on what that noise is and how relative it is to you. It has multiple modes (2 or 3 depending on the device) so you can switch the noise cancelling off if needed.\n\nFor example, it does a really great job of cancelling the loud construction noises outside my apartment, barking dogs, loud cars (including the construction vehicles) and people talking in the background but it doesn’t do as well as job of cancelling out the noise of my boyfriend streaming sports on the background. It cancels a good amount of the game and his “enthusiasm” but it doesn’t cancel as much as I wish it would.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns multiple apple devices, wants seamless connection, and is looking for a better noise cancelling solution than what the normal air pods offers.\n\nI would not recommend this if you don’t have apple devices or only have one but use android/other operating systems. Yes the noise cancelling feature is great, but at this price point it’s not worth it in comparison to other noise-cancelling headphones priced similarly.",

I work in music production, so i have a good baseline of experience with headphones of all different kinds. The noise cancelling, is probably the best I've ever heard. I'm not usually a fan of noise cancelling, except for plane flights, but these are exceptional in that regard.\nThings I don't like:\nThe headband has a very thin spandex type material that I'm positive will get torn the moment any mishap takes place. It's unnecessary to the design. Dumb.\nNo way to plug in for wired use, except for the apple charge to mini jack converter. Dumb.\nIf I didn't already have some bluetooth headphones that are really decent, I may have kept these.\nAfter all, these are \"spatial audio enabled\"! Whaaaaaaa???? What does that mean?\nWell, let's talk about that. I'm an audio professional and am interested in Dolby Atmos, which is now offered in Apple Music. So, when I heard about this, I couldn't throw my money at them fast enough to get these magic headphones that would put me in 3 dimensional music world. The headphones showed up today, and I put them to the test. Here's what happened.\n\nDolby Atmos Music on Apple AirPods Max headphones - Is it cool?\n\nI spent this evaluation time mostly in the Settings menu, switching the Dolby off and on between the lossless, so i could really hear the differences. In almost every case, the vocal was less present, more reverb (and I’m not ever a fan of adding reverb to a vocal that should be dry and in your face), the drums got pushed way back, and the expected surround effect wasn’t enough to win me over. I guess the effect of Atmos (at least in headphones) is similar to hearing the music performed in a live setting. Things are less present, more muted, and swimming in the room. But, I never got a sense of “whoa, it’s behind me” or “it’s above me”. What I got was a less present, mushier, sub-heavy version, that lacked the urgency of the original mix. This was true for mostly everything I heard.\n\nThe exception for me was the Art Blakey's \"Moanin'\", which because of the recording (1958), when often the stereo (2 channels or speakers) mixing style of the day involved each instrument hard panned to the left or right speaker, with little or no center position middle ground in the original mixes. The Atmos helps a bit by panning everybody slightly more center. In this case, one could argue, Atmos fixed a “problem”.\n\nOn most rock mixes, I still prefer the lossless. It sounds like the tendency of a few of these mixers (or maybe this is just what Dolby’s process does) has been to extend low frequency (sub) and push the drums out of the foreground. This isn’t awesome to me, when a lot of rock music craves in your face urgency. Overall, drums are just way mushier. Maybe this is just an unfortunate sign of early days of a format that's finding its sea legs.\n\nlistening on a home theater rig might change my mind about how cool Atmos is, but I really draw the line at adding reverb to music. And I know that’s going to be the first thing they reach for. I’m just not down. Call me old, call me cranky, but misplaced verb is stanky.\nIf Atmos for music is going to take off, it’s got to be within consumers’ reach AND it has to be good without being gimmicky.\nThe headphones have already been dropped at UPS for return. For this particular prosumer,'s the whole \"spatial thing\" is not quite ready for prime time.\n\nBest of luck,\nSkip",

			"body": "Real Talk - these are NOT \"Metal Beats Studios\" or whatever. These are 100% Apple. As such, they are designed and meant to be paired with Apple products. You do that, you are good to go.\n\nWhat you do not get: A charger. It uses the same one your iPhone or any other Apple Lightening thing you may have does. It comes with a cable. Mine is still in the box; I just charge from my computer. Apparently, this is a problem. I don't get it :)\n\nWhat you DO get:\n- A *very* immersive, *very isolated* soundstage. The Noise Cancellation is so insane, it is near \"witchcraft\" levels. It's legit. :)\n\n- 'Super Hearing' with Transparency Mode: If you have used this with AirPods Pro and where like \"yeah, ok, this works\"...this is more like \"Yeah. I can hear *everything* SUPER CLEARLY. Stop breathing so loud\"-levels and the \"mix in\" is really balanced with audio you may be listening to.\n\n- Spacial Audio on these things is hard to describe without sounding overly hyperbolic. The directionality is much more dialed in than the AP Pros, the \"behind you\" is really great. I wish it worked on my Mac tho. Maybe in the future.\n\nThe build on these is like...I have zero concern I will break them. Ever. I believe they could seriously injure someone if swung hard enough. Seriously.\n\nA lot of time and testing was put into the mechanisms, resistance of sliding, the sockets for the ear cups that rotate, very smoothly, but also have a firm, strong spring action for grip against your head.\n\nNow...there *is* a problem. If you wear glasses, they will start to irritate a little from pushing against the side of your head. it is not the ear cups, which are borderline pillows. it is the pressure/pressing of the arms of glasses into your head. Be aware of this.\n\nHandoff works great, call quality is great, very nice audio sep, highs do not sound sibilant unless they *actually are*, the bass is clear, not \"muddy\" and you *will* be hearing what you've been missing with these, like other headphones in this range. That's the really cool thing about these; hearing 'ghost notes' you never had before, studio sounds, etc. These really bring that stuff out.\n\nI am ambivalent about the case/'case' controversy. They don't, heh...these things don't need a case. Heh.\n\nThey are not inexpensive. They also...are not \"cheap\". There's a lot of \"sour grapes\" out there around these. They are indeed, at least twice as good as AirPod pros...so if you like those or the Beats sport wireless earbuds...and like music and stuff...you'll enjoy them. If you have to \"save up\" for them...worth it.",

			"body": "I decided to spoil myself and try these out. Reviewers say they're excellent and have the best ANC/transparency mode out there, and they damn well better for $550. So are they all they're hyped up to be? Is Apple taking the audio world by storm and revolutionizing music as we know it? No. Not by a long shot.\n\nI'll try to categorize and simplify my thoughts:\n\n-Build Quality:\nIn classic Apple fashion, the hardware is very good. Metal and high quality fabrics are present, no Apple logos or graphics to stain the clean and sleek design, and the magnetic replaceable earcups are genius (albeit expensive at $69 a pair).\n\n-Controls\nThe button/knob wheel combo is simple yet effective. I much prefer physical buttons to touch controls (The Sony WH-1000XM3's have infuriating touch controls and apparently the M4's aren't much better) and Apple does it right. One button to switch between ANC/transparency mode and no mode at all, and the knob to control the volume as well as play and pause. Super simple, as it should be. However, I couldn't help but notice how little resistance the buttons have, which makes them easy to press. This resulted in me accidentally pressing something almost every time I put on/took off/adjusted my headphones if I grabbed them from the top. Just something to note.\n\n-ANC/Transparency Mode:\nTransparency mode on these is EXCELLENT. Voices almost sound like they're in your head and everything is made not only louder, but clearer as well. Much better than the Airpod Pros. The ANC however, to me was a bit of a let down. It was difficult finding the different between ANC and no mode at all, but I suspect this might have something to do with....\n\n-The Fit\nI have a big problem with the fit. It's a little hard to explain in text but I'll give it a shot. Ideally, when the headphones are put on, the main cans sit flat on your ears and are parallel to each other to create a nice seal around your ear, like this {| |} . But due to the hinge design that connects the main cans to the headband, they have too much area to move around in a sense, and they end up fitting more like this {/ \\} , which results in too much pressure being applied at the top of the main cup and not enough at the button, creating an opening at the button of my ear where not only the music escapes through, but outside noise bleeds in as well. I have tried every length and adjusted them in every way possible but that is an unavoidable flaw in the design. Could it be due to my weird head shape? Possibly, but it's not something I've never experienced in over-ear headphones, so I'm blaming Apple for this one.\n\n-Sound\nSo they don't fit well and ANC is balls. Could the sound save it perhaps? Will you weep in joy at the Apple engineering that made such beautiful vocals and trembling bass possible? No. I would call it average. SLIGHTLY better than the Airpod Pros. My V-Moda M-100's, almost a decade old, sh!t on these, spit in their face, curb stomp them, pick them up, then sh!t on them once more, all at half the price (and they straight KILL them once I connect them to my FiiO BTR5) all at half the price or so. Sound is okay, bass is lacking for me, volume is shockingly low. Just an overall disappointment.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nThese aren't bad headphones at all, not by any means. Great build quality, banging transparency mode, and average sound. But for five hundred and FIFTY DOLLARS it should be FANTASTIC sound, with SILENT ANC, and more accessories than a single cable and a DIAPER for a case (which is frankly pathetic). There is much better out there for cheaper. I personally recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4's (I actually have the M3's but they're apparently really similar to the M4's so not enough for me to upgrade but great deal for first time buyers). Great sound, great ANC, great fit, comfortable, wonky controls but not a dealbreaker, with actual useful accessories and a proper carrying case at half the price. Or V-Modas. Or Sennheisers. Or Airpod Pros. Anything within the $200-$300 range really will do anything these do and most likely better. I generally like Apple products and can justify owning my Airpods (both regular and Pros), iPad, and even the Watch, as they offer an experience I just can't quite get with other products, through the hardware and software, but these are a giant swing and a miss, and I will be returning them within the week. I am not rating it 2 stars because they're bad. I am rating it as such for the incredibly bad value for money you're getting.",
