      "body": "I purchased this for my three young boys. I setup a media center and homework station for them off to the side of our living room. I mounted this mini PC on the back of a 40\" Vizio TV. This mini PC is quite powerful. I haven't purchased a new PC in about 5 years and was pleasantly surprised at how quick this PC actually is. My last purchase was a Dell i7 of some sort from 2018. This new PC absolutely crushes my last PC on the benchmarks and it is simply snappy fast and quite noticeable even when doing simple tasks.\n\nI purchased this during Cyber Week and got an excellent deal. I think for the price, there likely isn't anything out there that is remotely comparable. This little PC is a beast.\n\nI do find the cooling fans to be a bit noisy when the PC is under heavy load, but for our uses, we hardly ever stress the system enough to begin with. The Ryzen 7 graphics are pretty good, and it will run most games on reduced settings. I personally have not tested too many modern games on this unit as of yet, but it does really well with the slightly older games that I might regularly play.\n\nThe case seems quite solid and this PC is really small. Even though it is small, it still has more than enough in and out ports for most users. I have had zero issues with the PC so far, not a single hanging mouse or even a stutter. This is an excellent little machine in my opinion.",

      "body": "I've used Raspberry Pi single board computers for home projects for many years. Finding them very capable machines for most tasks. Recently I was using an rpi4 to serve web mapping software. Then I used the Pi4 to also view the Leaflet based web maps. Worked great. Then I found CesiumJS 3D maps. The Pi4 was now slow. Buying an rpi5 made things a lot faster, but it wasn't smooth yet.\n\nAfter buying a fancy new power supply, uSD card and case for my rpi5 I've spent half the cost of this SER5 5700U. My desktop is an AMD 3600 with GeForce GTX 1660. This SER5 is just as capable a machine, for less than half what I spent on that system.\n\nMy goal is to use this SER5 5700U for presentations. Offering enough power to serve the entire container stack locally, in places where I have little to no internet access. The SER5 has been good enough to do a lot of development on the machine. I got started there just to burn in test it. It's an amazingly competent system for all kinds of home lab tasks.\n\nAt this point it's still running fully stock. However, I liked the setup so much that I've purchased a laptop with the same 5700U. And purchased a single 32GB DDR4 SODIMM to perform a lopsided upgrade on the SER5. If it's unhappy or slow with mismatched 8+32GB chips, I buy another 32GB SODIMM. But my understanding is that the first 16GB should perform the same, then get a slower (~5%) on the additional 24GB. If that's all, I can easily live with that drop, when it would have lost a lot more performance swapping. If this isn't the case I'll buy another 32GB chip. The pulled 8GB SODIMM will upgrade my Asus laptop, which shipped with a lopsided 8+4GB of RAM (8GB soldered to the motherboard).\n\nI loved that the SER5 has normal DDR4 SODIMM RAM, upgradable to 64GB. Plus room to add an SSD or swap out for a larger M.2 card. I've successfully used a usb3 attached m.2 card, and connected 3 monitors to it. All hardware recognized and works fine in Linux. Happily suspends and wakes up on power button pushes.\n\nSeamlessly using a BT keyboard and mouse. The performance with 3D mapping software output at 4K is flawless. Even when running the full back-end stack required to serve all of the map data locally. All while it's nearly silent and running cool. The rpi5 got very hot, even sitting on a static 3d scene and pulling data from the internet map sources. This machine draws a little more power, and is a little bigger than an rpi5. But the performance it offers is in an different league.\n\nWhen my desktop finally dies. I suspect one of these will be replacing it.",

      "body": "This is an impressive little machine. I purchased this to replace a windows 7 computer my folks have been using which is a “thinks it can run windows 10 machine.” I figured I would bring them into 2023. They’re both approaching 80 and have no problem using this one. Even the power button is front and center meaning easy to find.\n\nIt’s light years more advanced. First off setup couldn’t have been easier. It has everything you need in the box. Two HDMIs - one short and one longer. I also purchased a new monitor for them and it came with a cord, but it was a nice touch for those who want to attach it to the back of a display.\n\nPrinter drivers and everything else installed easy peasy. The worst part of this was setting up windows 11! Microsoft wants control of everything and their greedy little paws in every facet of your life. Supposedly there is a way to set it up without an account, but I couldn’t get it to work so I created a fake account which no one will ever use for anything other than updating this computer. Then I declined all their sales pitches and accept this and that from location tracking to ad targeting to whatever else. If Macs weren’t so much I would have bought them one.\n\nI have no idea if it will run games. It surfs the web beautifully and YouTube videos are no problem at all. I did watch some YouTube review videos on this machine before buying it and they did say it will do some gaming if that’s your thing. Build quality seems top notch.\n\nIn closing…Microsoft stinks. BeeLink? Fantastic!",

I appreciate that it comes with lots of useful ports so I also replaced my docking station with a 7 dollar one bought in temu.com (lol... did it just for fun).\n\nHowever, I was slightly unhappy that the description says it's Linux OS but it actually came with Windows 11 Pro. I tested Ubuntu with no issues though. Well, I actually don't mind getting Windows after all (RDP to work using Windows is nicer than using Linux), but it's just different from description.\n\nHighly recommended product!",

      "body": "I own 6 Beelink Mini PCs. All of them run Linux, 5 of them SER5 due to issues I had with SER6 (maybe a Linux issue) and SER7 (probably a Linux issue). This Beelink SER5 MAX runs Debian desktop and 3 monitors. It is solid. This unit has 64GB RAM as I can't deal with 16GB or 32GB on main machines without constantly running into that max.\n\nI don't game, but I use a lot of virtual machines, applications and tend to be a browser-tab hog. Too often working up to multiple hundreds of tabs across multiple browser instances. I've encountered no issues due to that.\n\nThe only issue I've encountered is when running a desktop VM from this machine while accessing it from the same machine. It seems a little laggy too often. However, if I RDP to a different box and then RDP to the local VM from that box on one of the screens, it behaves the same as RDPing from a full-sized PC with a dedicated graphics card.\n\nI love these boxes. They offer near all of the benefits of a desktop computer but require substantially less space and use quite a bit less power. I finally got a UPS for my desk where I can see power consumption regularly, and running a SER5 Max, a SER5 Pro, 5 monitors, a firewall and a switch, it pulls less than 115 watts for regular use. My old desktop box was pulling over that just sitting there with 3 monitors on without a local firewall.\n\nI only purchased my first Beelink MiniPC about 7 months ago, but through everything, they seem solid. I don't have need for any more, outside maybe a media box for a TV, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this, or at least any other SER5, at this time. I know there are other Mini PC brands available, but I see no reason to look beyond Beelink unless something changes.",

That's not the fault of the manufacturer or the vendor.\n\nBut the power supply died within 48 hours. Sent a message to the vendor and got no answer. Luckily, I had a standard laptop power supply around and that's what the unit takes. I'm happy with the device, but not the vendor.",
