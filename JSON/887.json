No drills, no screws, just slap 'em on and you're good to go. It's like they were made for ultimate convenience.\n\nIf you're tired of the whole drill-and-screw ordeal, these adhesive hooks are your new best friends. Nursery vibes are strong, and those portraits? They're staying put. It's heavy-duty awesomeness in the easiest way possible, bro. üñºÔ∏èüî•",
