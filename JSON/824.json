I love the fact that it’s not like any other surge protector I have ever seen. It’s very small and compact. I got it because I used to nock my Internet cord from the wall all the time, and now I don’t have to worry about that!! of course I use it for other cords too! It’s cool, because the outlets are spaced apart enough that the cords don’t run into each other. You can take advantage of all the outlets if you need to. When I bought it, it was a great price too! It’s still on sale and I might buy it for a friend. Even though I don’t know this brand, I say you should get it while it is still on sale. However, the regular price is not so bad either but who doesn’t want a good deal!",

			"title": "Buy it for the outlet layout and USB ports, not the surge protection.",
			"body": "I don't trust these unknown products for serious surge protection. I basically consider them to be about the same as a regular \"remote power tap\" (power strip) with no surge protection, and I have it plugged in to a \"real\" surge protector on the wall outlet, but the socket layout on this product is excellent. Somehow I have managed to plug small \"wall wart\" sized plugs into EVERY outlet on ALL sides without any difficulty at all.\n\nGranted, all the wall warts in this case are pretty small, but with most power strips almost always one of them blocks another outlet or something and at least one or two power sockets goes unused due to being blocked by something else. Amazingly, that hasn't happened yet with this one.\n\nSo this is a pretty major accomplishment in the field of industrial design here.\n\nI also have this securely screwed down to the back of a desk using the keyholes on the back of the power tap. Unlike many poorly designed products out there, the keyholes on this power strip are of reasonable dimensions and I didn't have any trouble finding suitable screws in my random screw pile.\n\nHowever, I really do not understand why almost no power strip manufacturer includes the screws needed to fit the keyhole dimensions on their product! This would be especially helpful in cases where the keyhole dimensions are metric and the product is sold in a country where most of the screws laying around are not metric\n\nPlease, for the love of god, please just include the mounting screws that match the product. I don't even want drywall anchors, just the screws that fit that are long enough to support the forces involved (weight of the strip, cables, AND force of unplugging things). It's one of those things that is very cheap compared to the amount of trouble involved when the needed screws are not somehow just laying around nearby.\n\nAs for the USB charging ports, I never expect much from the ones on power strips. I only use those to power or charge low-power 0.5-1A devices and these seem to do that just fine. I do not use them to charge phones or tablets or anything else these days that benefits from better chargers. So I didn't bother to test them with anything that can use more than 1A at most.\n\nI also didn't check to see if the DC USB supply produces HF radio noise. This is a problem with a lot of cheap USB chargers that use switching power supplies without sufficient filter capacitors and such. It might be a problem for me except I haven't done any HF radio in a while, but anyway it's another potential quality issue that could use some testing. (For those who don't know, people doing HF ham radio often need to pick up weak long-distance radio signals that can easily be \"jammed\" by radio noise from poor quality electronics.)\n\nSo for my main requirements which are: can connect everything easily, can mount to back of wooden desk securely, and can charge low-power USB gadgets, this is a definite 5/5 with no headaches.",

			"title": "Excellent!",
			"body": "I've got lots of things that need to be plugged in - there are various areas in my house and work spaces where I have multiple power adapter/charger type plugs and more.\n\nThe first truly fantastic thing about this is the FLAT PLUG that goes into the wall outlet. If you have an outlet that furniture or something needs to be as close to wall as possible, you don't want the standard sticking-out plug. The offset cord-plug means no problem plugging something else in the other wall outlet receptacle. The design with 4 outlets on top, and 2 outlets on each of 2 sides means I can actually use all 8 outlets if I need unlike any other power strip I have used in the past! (Because the power cubes/chargers inevitably prevent using some of the outlets.) When you add four USB ports on another side to provide charging, some surge protection with led indicator, and a velcro tie permanently and well-attached to the cord - and deliver one to me when it's on sale under $10!??? After I tried 1, I bought 4 more. These are great! (The product bottom has ETL and Intertek mark & I did locate the listing on the Intertek ETL directory with search on the model # ahr-803.) Now, don't expect super-fast charging from any of the USB charging ports, they are pretty much limited to max of 5watt-charge per port (I didn't try charging 4 things at once)\n\n(I live in area where thunderstorms are very rare. I have lived in areas where that is not the case, and I would not rely on this, or any power strip, to provide surge protection. If the main service to your residence or workplace you plug into does not have adequate grounding and protection, the best you can hope for is your power strip gets damaged without affecting anything plugged into it when lightning strikes close enough to your service.)",

Of course, this entails me having to get up from a prone position. The beauty of this surge protector is with its long electrical cord, I'm able to place it wherever I need it at the level I need. With the capability to plug in eight devices, I'm able to plug in lights and/or Alexa assisted lights, phones, shredder, and computer related devices. If I happened to utilize all of the electrical outlets, I still have four USB ports I can use to charge devices all within easy reach of my hands.",

			"title": "Powerful Potential, But Not Without Pitfalls: The 6 Ft Surge Protector Power Strip Reviewed",
			"body": "In a digital age where our lives are intertwined with a myriad of devices, the need for a reliable surge protector becomes paramount. The 6 Ft Surge Protector Power Strip, with its dual promise of safeguarding electronics and simplifying power management, caught my eye. Offering an array of eight electrical outlets and four USB ports, it seemed poised to declutter and streamline the energy consumption in my tech-heavy home environment. This surge protector suggested a solution to the perennial problem of insufficient charging points and the tangled web of cables that often plague our spaces.\n\nHowever, as I integrated the surge protector into my daily routine, I encountered a blend of efficiency and limitations. While it adeptly powered a variety of devices, from laptops to kitchen appliances, the surge protector's real-world application illuminated both its strengths and areas in need of improvement. This nuanced experience provided a comprehensive understanding of its capability to meet the modern household's power demands.\n\nPros:\n\n🔌 Extensive Outlet Array: The expansive offering of outlets and USB ports transformed my workspace, reducing clutter and eliminating the need for additional power strips. This feature alone significantly elevated the utility of the surge protector, making it a central hub for all electronic charging needs.\n\nCons:\n\n🔋 USB Charging Speed: The convenience of built-in USB ports was tempered by their less-than-ideal charging speed. Compared to dedicated fast-charging adapters, these ports lagged, particularly noticeable when I needed a quick recharge for my devices.\n\nPros:\n\n🔧 Innovative Design Solutions: The surge protector's flat plug design was a subtle yet impactful feature, allowing furniture to be placed closer to the wall and freeing up space. The option for wall mounting offered further versatility, though it came with its own set of challenges.\n\nCons:\n\n🛠 Stability with Wall Mounting: Despite the practicality of mounting the surge protector to save space, its design did not fully support the weight when loaded with multiple cables, leading to a slight sag. This did not impede functionality but raised questions about long-term durability and aesthetics.\n\nAs I reflect on my time with the 6 Ft Surge Protector Power Strip, it stands as a testament to the evolving needs of our connected lives. It capably addresses the demand for more power sources and the convenience of USB charging, yet it does not fully escape the shadow of its imperfections. The slow USB charging speeds and the minor issue with wall-mount stability highlight that while close to ideal, there is room for refinement.\n\nThis surge protector represents a significant stride towards the ideal of streamlined, efficient power management within our homes and workspaces. Its ability to reduce clutter and centralize charging stations underlines its value, making it a worthy consideration for anyone looking to enhance their power setup. As we continue to navigate the challenges of keeping our myriad devices powered and protected, the 6 Ft Surge Protector Power Strip serves as a reliable ally, albeit one that reminds us of the ongoing journey towards perfection in our digital ecosystem. Here’s to future innovations that will further bridge the gap between convenience and functionality.",
