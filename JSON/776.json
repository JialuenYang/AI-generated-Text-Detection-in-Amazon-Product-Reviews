      "body": "Best nail clippers these beat out anything I‚Äôve ever had from a drug store. I get long nails quickly as a woman. But I also play the guitar. So I cannot keep long nails. I have to clip every week before I update the polish my nails. These clippers are the real deal. The small one is great and my husband he uses the bigger one. Get these!",
