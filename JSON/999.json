			"body": "The CA Perfume Impression of Mojave Ghost has been a delightful discovery. This fragrance body oil captures the essence of the original scent, transporting me to a serene desert landscape every time I wear it. The fact that it's alcohol-free is a huge plus, ensuring that the fragrance remains true to its notes without the sharpness that some alcohol-based perfumes can have.\n\nThe roll-on design is convenient, especially for on-the-go touch-ups. Its travel size makes it a staple in my purse, and the 0.3 Fl Oz/10ml quantity ensures it lasts a good while. The scent's longevity is impressive, lingering on the skin for hours without being overpowering. The aromatherapy aspect adds a therapeutic dimension, making it more than just a fragrance.\n\nHowever, while the scent is beautifully crafted, it might not resonate with everyone, given its unique desert-inspired notes. It's always a good idea to test it out before committing to a larger bottle. But for those who appreciate a distinctive and evocative fragrance, this is a real gem.\n\nAnd for a dad joke: Why did the perfume go to school? It wanted to be scent-sational!",
