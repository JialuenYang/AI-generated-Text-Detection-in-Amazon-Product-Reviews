			"body": "95% of people will buy this just to be able to connect their wired headphones to their iPhone, but what they won't realize is this a very capable DAC/amp (emphasis more on the DAC) that powers relatively low impedance headphones with ease and measures incredibly well for the price. I plugged HD58x's into these (relatively easy to power) and they got plenty loud enough and sounded great. You can tell when going from something like a Liquid Spark or JDS Atom to this that the openness and separation does suffer a little bit, but it's shocking how close they are.\n\nWhat this won't do is properly power high impedance headphones. It's not a ton of power into 32 ohms, so when you start to get to 250 ohms+ it's not capable enough to take full advantage of what those headphones can do.\n\nStill, this is absolutely the best DAC/amp you can buy for under $10 and represents one of the best values in audio in my opinion. I didn't really need this for any specific reason, but I bought it to play around with and am super pleased with its performance. I'll still use my desktop setup most of the time, but if I want to walk around the house and don't want to use Bluetooth, this is the only way to go.\n\nIf you're just looking for a converter and don't understand or care about most of what is written above, you'll also be very pleased. Essentially, these will make your headphones sound better while providing a strong, secure connection into your phone. I can't recommend this product enough.",

			"body": "Got this for an iPhone SE to connect to a variety of audio setups..... Stand alone speakers didn't seem to be an issue (even ones that have interference issues with some computers) ..... A high quality, though old [at this point] home theater system with 8 speakers did not work with this cable (and I regularly connect computers to the system as well as phones and other devices with headphone jacks without a single problem) .... The phone itself has no issue recognizing the cable, though it classifies it as an input device, rather than what it is, output. The home theater didn't recognize audio input with this cable. And THAT is the main reason for my returning the item.... I wanted to connect the iPhone SE to have it stream music (mainly 'cause the battery life is so much better on the phone than on any computer)..... Also got a little odd in the car..... To begin with, this cable is EXTREMELY short.... I do have a high end extender for headphone jack type cables that has worked with everything I've used it on (including other phones & computers), BUT, when I plugged it into this lightning adapter, the car's stereo didn't recognize the input at all..... Directly connecting the short lighting cable to the car's stereo had mixed results --- cutting in and out at random....\n\nSo, this cable may be good for some folks and not so much for others. You have to consider the age and complexity of the equipment you intend to connect to --- some older, more technical stuff, may not work; old speakers (tested with a pair that's 40yrs old) work just fine, but a home theater type system is a diff't beast.\n\nThe one thing this short little cable definitely has going for it is its resistance to interference. No matter what speaker I connected it to, there was never an interference issue .... I actually tinkered a bit with the two large speakers from the high end home theater system to allow them to connect directly to this lightning cable as standalone units to test the quality of the sound..... Variety of music types ALL came through with clear, crisp sound..... The low ends, deep bass, etc. all sound exactly as they should. There is no distortion or loss at all.\n\nVolume control..... The cable itself doesn't have its own volume control (and given the length of the cable, why would it be needed?) , however it doesn't interfere with the phone's volume control capabilities at all.\n\nThat all said..... I returned the cable because it doesn't work where it's most needed. Also concerned about the fact that it registers with the phone as an input device; this opens the door for the cable to not work at all at any point.",

			"body": "I'm on this page to purchase a new adapter just like the one (or 2?)I previously used, which seems to have been lost by the certain kiddo of mine who loses stuff as often as I do—or misplaced by me.\n\nOkay, first, so I first purchased the now-lost adapter from *this* listing/this seller, as Amazon points out at the top of this page. (See pic.)\n\nSecond, even minor audio stuff is a bigger deal to me than (I really imagine) to most people, as my actual professional is that of a professional \"art music\" [\"classical\" musician, as most understandably say—but that term has some problems of which of course I'll spare you the details here]. So, all I'm saying is, I notice audio quality, & I have little patience even for arguably poor CALL quality or whatnot. For these reasons, I think I'm qualified to assure you.\n\nLast time I got this from this retailer, there was, as I recall, no concern about any generic-type packagIng—no concern about it being a knock-off immediately.\n\nMore important, as this was my first such adapter, I remember being quite pleasantly pleased with everything about it. I used it with whichever iPhone(s) I had at the time for calls & on-the-go media listening, as well as a with my iPad Pro for listening, recording, etc., with earbuds when whatever I was listening to was not some huge deal, and for more-huge-deal listening with my beloved Audio-Technicas,, a [surprisingly great, particularly for noise cancelling] paid of Bose, or either of my \"audiophile\" young kids' high-end Sonys (&, btw, I'm not ax mum who gets my kids unduly high-end things, but I found those, obviously MAjorly mistakenly under-priced on Amazon Prime Now ~15 months ago, so I of course snatched those instead of getting the correctly priced cheap ones).\n\nNO PROBLEM AT ALL with this adapter, for however long I had it readily available (maybe over a year), & I've personally no reason to have believs the seller has \"gone to the dark side\" or whatever.\n\nBUT, as I'm ordering a couple of so more of these today for same-day delivery, I PROMISE you that if there's ANY problem, I'll add an addendum to this. Okay? (And, yeah, I KNOW a lot of folks say stuff like that, but they unexpectedly get too busy, or forget, or have become so fed up with Amz they can't tolerate anything concerning reviews. I get it. But, when it comes to anything that disrupts my music-listening or playing, I'll hop on Amazon to warn folks. (Not the case [as consistently] with so many of the not-well-considered, purchased, cheap clothing, my very rare \"home decor\" purchases or whatever.\n\nAnd, you know, I used to review thingx rather diligently because the review set-up used to be (long, long ago) really helpful. But now, there are so many maddeningly obvious fake reviews, and maddeningly non-obvious (paid-for)!fake reviews—sellersv getting pressured to hype their often-pointless drop-ship merchandise, or (even worse) sellers paying folks to rip apart competitors' wares. The system now has too little utility for me to bother with it.\n\nBut, as I promised, if there's a problem with my new purchase here, I'll let you know. If I don't (by, like, early February 2021), you can assume I'm pleased as punch with the new purchase (or that something terrible has happened in, or to, my life—but as I'm confined to home, with good security system, & as we're in good health these days, just assume the news adapters all worked out.\n\nOkay. Metrorail stop coming up, so I'll end this odd review with verrbose, general commentary, Take care.",
