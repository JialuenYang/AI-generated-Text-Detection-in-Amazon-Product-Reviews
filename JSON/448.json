It's also very convenient that there is a nice clip on it which makes it easy to carry around and hard to loose. I think the price was great for the amount of pens it came with and for how long it lasted me for!!!",

I find the Z-Grip to be particularly comfortable to write with, and the ink is very smooth and vibrant for a budget pen. The metal pocket clip is also a nice touch at this price level. Like the Bic Round Stic, the Zebra Z-Grip is one of those humble workhorse pens that you'll find floating around restaurants, piled high in the supply cabinet at your office, or you may be using one to fill out paperwork at the doctor's office. However, I really like using the pen for my personal needs because it's so smooth and comfortable with boldly-colored ink. I recommend it, especially for people wanting a super-smooth pen at a super-reasonable price.",

Probably to prevent any air getting at the ink and so they won't dry up say 8 months from now just sitting in the package they came in . I read some of the reviews and people were saying they don't work , so I was unsure whether to buy them or not , so when I got them I couldn't wait to try one to see how well they work and sure enough I could see what the problem was , just as I thought .

Two big problems I saw with them (but again, you kind of get what you pay for):\n\nThey run out of ink pretty fast. I’ve been a little disappointed with how fast I run through the ink. I write a bit, but not an abnormal amount. Really just in my journal every day, and usually only a few pages at most (small 5x7-ish sized notebook). But luckily the package is large, so I’m not too worried about that. Just may.l not be the most cost-effective option if you’re buying for an office or other environment where you will be writing a lot.\n\nThe other thing I haven’t loved is the speed that the ink leaves the pen. If I’m just writing it seems to work fairly well, with only a few letters here and there coming out slightly faded. But if you try to draw a line (I usually put a line between journal entries so I can maximize page usage… because I use my journals a lot), it fades halfway across my page (again, it’s only like 4-5” across…). So not super ideal for anything more than regular text writing or something along those lines. Any continuous lines tend to run out of ink and you have the lift the pen and start again. Maybe a weird complaint, but I know people who use these types of pens for art and other things like that - so I would not recommend these for that.\n\nOverall, even with these complaints, I feel like for the price, these are pretty good pens.

			"title": "Great ink + smooth writing for the fastest drying time and cheapest price!",
			"body": "I have finally found my favorite pens for serving! I love pens. I am obsessed with them and I try everything. But while it's easy to find the nicest thickest ink pens, the ones I use when I'm home, and judge those...it's arguably much harder to find the \"best cheap pen.\" I mean, a good ballpoint pen is hard to find, period! That's why I only use them when I have to.\n\nI have had a consistent issue when it comes to my job as a server in a restaurant. The pens that write nice and thick and smoothly (which they need to as I have <5 seconds to write down everything my guest is saying) then transfer ink onto my hands and onto my receipts and everything else in my book once I shut it. Still, I would rather take some messy ink transfer than be struggling to get out any ink in the first place and cramp up my hand from having to use so much pressure at a hard angle (as required by other ballpoint pens). This is why I have just been using nicer ballpoint pens and doing my best to mitigate the mess. Bottomline: I need ink to come out fast and dry fast and it's been a struggle\n\nUntil I just happened upon one of these...and immediately rushed to order more! This is legitimately the first pen I have found that writes and produces ink as well as it does while simultaneously drying as fast as it does and therefore transferring ink as little as it does. While I don't know if I'll ever find a perfect balance, these pens are my new favorite. They last pretty well, especially for the price. They are very comfortable to hold and use - balancing weight, width, and size well. The biggest standout again, is how quickly they dry. I would be paying a lot more for these if I had to!\n\nMy main complaint is that the bottom tip unscrews. Something that of course most pens can do (and something that is a problem for some pens more than others). It is pretty bad for these ones in particular. I haven't had one burst or fall apart; it's only as I'm writing the tip starts to unscrew and fall down and I have to quickly screw it back into place so it keeps working/producing ink. This happens a lot more when I'm using these pens vs. others. I would almost prefer them to dry out quicker vs. coming apart so quickly!\n\nI am putting them under a lot of stress though, as you can imagine. I don't think they would cause me nearly as much trouble otherwise.",

The grip was comfortable, the writing was SMOOTH, and the ink was beautiful. I took like five photos of the pen and then found them here on Amazon and immediately bought what can only be considered a bushel of them. These are now my go-to pens. I don't use anything else.\n\nI know I'm old when I find such pleasure in a simple pen, but that's fine by me. Sometimes it's the simple pleasures in life that you enjoy the most, and every time I write something down I get reminded that these pens are really enjoyable to write with.",
