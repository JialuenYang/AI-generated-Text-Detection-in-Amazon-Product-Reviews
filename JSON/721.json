As someone who is conscious about what I put into my body, I appreciate that BetterBody Foods sources their coconut oil from organic coconuts. This not only ensures a higher quality product, but also supports sustainable and ethical farming practices.\n\nOne of the main reasons I was interested in trying this MCT oil was because of its keto-friendliness. As someone who follows a ketogenic diet, I am always on the lookout for quality fats to incorporate into my meals. The fact that this MCT oil is made from 100% medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and contains both C8 and C10 fatty acids makes it the perfect addition to my keto meal plan.\n\nI have used this MCT oil in various ways, including adding it to my morning coffee for a boost of energy and mental clarity, incorporating it into my salad dressings for a healthy dose of healthy fats, and using it as a cooking oil for stir-fries and roasted vegetables. The subtle coconut flavor adds a nice touch to any dish without being overpowering.\n\nWhat sets this MCT oil apart from others on the market is its high concentration of C8 and C10 fatty acids. These are considered the most beneficial MCTs for energy and metabolism, making it a great choice for those following a keto or low carb diet. Additionally, this MCT oil is gluten-free, making it suitable for those with dietary restrictions.\n\nThe 16.9 oz bottle is a generous size and lasts a long time, even with daily use. The packaging is also well-designed and user-friendly, with a convenient flip-top lid that allows for easy pouring.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend BetterBody Foods' Organic Coconut 100% MCT Oil for anyone looking for a high-quality, keto-friendly, and versatile MCT oil. It's a great addition to any healthy lifestyle and I will definitely be purchasing it again in the future.",
