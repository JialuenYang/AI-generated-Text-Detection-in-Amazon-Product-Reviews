These hangers are not just another accessory in my closet, but an innovative and elegant solution for the storage and organization of my jeans and pants. The first thing I noticed and liked was the packaging, as the product arrived in perfect condition.\nThese hangers promise durability and a firm hold on clothes, because of the material, they are made of metal. Also, their non-slip design is a detail that makes all the difference; I no longer have to worry about pants slipping and falling to the closet floor.\nThe 2 way hanging design offers incredible versatility. I can choose to hang my pants extended to avoid wrinkles or use the compact mode to maximize space, as my closet space is limited and this design is very functional for me, I loved it. This is an investment I recommend 100%.",
