To me it sounded a bit tinny but finally decided its because there was nothing in my other ear to balance out the base.. so I don't care a lot for listening to music but it can be done. However, for listening to audio books and for talking on the phone I find it very pleasurable.. for the price of it I have absolutely no complaints. It also holds a charge all day for what I use it for. Granted I don't have it stuck in my ear 12 hours a day. It's a really nice little Bluetooth. I would recommend it especially for audio books and phone talking..",

It is no frills. No connecting to your contacts to let you know who is calling. The voice/sound clarity is surprisingly good, and the battery life exceeded my expectations. Fits comfortably in ear with just the pre installed ear piece. Pairs to devices seamlessly. The one thing that’s a little annoying is that the on-off voice reporting on my unit is a little loud, but not a deal breaker. Called my brother and he said he could hear me just fine. Sound is great on my iPad too. Time will tell if it holds up. Don’t expect it to perform or function like something costing $100 or more. But for $16 it’s a good, basic Bluetooth for that money, and maybe a little bit better. Not sorry at all for purchasing it. It’s a 5 Star $16 Bluetooth.",

It’s much faster and easier to turn the on and off. The earhook they provide is a piece of junk and I don’t use it, but it comes with an assortment of earpieces covers. I use one of the covers that holds in my ear and it’s easy to switch from left to right that way. I like that they send a little case for it too so you can throw it in your bag without damaging it. The only thing it’s missing in my opinion is a mute button.",

			"title": "Average but fine",
			"body": "I could just as easily given this 4 stars...my real grade is a 3.5 star. It's mediocre, but it's solid enough that it's very good for the price. It's been a while since I had to buy a bluetooth earpiece, and I was pretty disappointed in the selection. I realize not many people use these anymore, but I don't like the 2-ear headphone option, and I don't like talking on my car's bluetooth. I was prepared to spend on a \"good one\" this go-around, but found almost none that consistently performed well and people really seemed to like. I considered buying a $200 one but even that had such mixed reviews when I looked at the most recent reviews. This one seemed solid at worst, so I figured I'd get it and maybe keep looking for a great one (which I didn't lol).\n\nThis thing is a little bigger and thicker than it needs to be, but not by much. And once you get it connected, it's solid. Sound quality is fine and I never ever lose connection. Volume isn't the loudest but typically good enough. Where it's terrible is if it's off and you want to turn it on and answer an incoming call. Every other bluetooth in my life (a lot) has automatically connect to the call within a few seconds. Not this thing. Ever. It'll take a few seconds, then connect for a few seconds, that go mute again. Then nowhere for a few seconds...not on bluetooth or your phone. Absolutely maddening if you even try, and I learned not to. So I either leave it on, or I answer on my iphone. Maybe I just stay on speaker, or if I know it's a lengthy conversation, I ask if I can call them right back. If there's no incoming call activity, I can turn on the bluetooth and it will connect in 10 seconds or so, and then I'm fine. But it took a little getting used to, having to plan around not being able to just turn it on and take a call. And frankly it's annoying as hell I have to, and the reason for only 3 stars. Borderline ridiculous with tech today. But once you get past that, it performs well and consistently. Certainly worth the $30 or whatever I paid for it. Even if you have it as a dependable backup and look for something better.",

My other two were difficult to use by touch, especially while on a call. This one is way better. SOUND quality is excellent; lacks a bit in treble (s and t sounds while talking). So words with t's and s's lose a bit of the highs. That's the only sound difference I can hear on testing. I would not hesitate to get this model.

It is compatible with the iPhone, but Siri will not announce your incoming calls to ask whether to answer or not, or read your text messages. You will need to manually do that yourself. I'm not use to having the manual control features such as volume, on/off, answering calls etc. attached to my earpiece. Sometimes when I'm talking it slips from my ear, and while trying to adjust it, I accidently push a button ending the call. But for the price, and the battery life, it will do. But I LOVE my Airpods.

			"body": "This is my third bluetooth headset in the past year or so. I had a $30 Conambo that had excellent sound quality but had some problems switching between voice rooms on discord. Unfortunately it developed some problem while charging after a year or so and it melted the USB connector onto my charging cable one day while it was plugged in. I guess I know why they don't let you talk on these while they are charging! I then went downscale and tried a $10 Yuwiss headset that ended up being a total mess. So I went back up a bit in price to try out this New Bee headset.\n\nBackground: I use my headset paired with both my phone and my computer. On the phone I use it for calling and listening to podcasts while walking outside. On the computer I use it for Discord for chatting while gaming. Being able to pair to both devices is critical along with at least 4 hours of battery life and comfort.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* I like the design that hangs in my ear and doesn't require a piece going over the ear. This makes it more comfortable to wear with sunglasses. It stays in my ear well enough for walking and general yard work. I don't know if it would stay in place for running without an ear hook, though.\n* The battery seems to last a long time. I haven't run it out yet\n* When I switch rooms in discord I don't have to re-select the headset to get it to work. For some reason with the Conambo I did have to do that which was really annoying.\n* Wind doesn't create noise through the earpiece when listening to audio outside. I can't comment on whether that behavior changes if you are on a call and using the microphone. The active noise cancelling on some other headsets gets confused by wind noise and amplifies it and plays it back in your ear. Thankfully this headset does not!\n* Almost no sound dropouts when walking with my phone in my pocket. Other headsets have problems with this situation (static electricity causing problems with the antennas?). This connection has very few interruptions.\n* Sound quality is acceptable. It isn't as good as the Conambo, but is far better than the Yuwiss.\n\nTHE BAD:\n* If I turn the headset on in range of my computer it pairs with both my phone and computer. As soon as I walk out of range of my computer it says \"disconnected\" which is fine, but it continues to say \"disconnected\" EVERY 10 SECONDS! I have to turn the headset off and then back on and re-pair with just my phone to get it to stop saying that. I almost returned this headset over this issue, but have instead decided to just live with it.\n* Pairing is sometimes flaky. No inexpensive headset seems to have worked out how to handle pairing to two devices simultaneously so that it works perfectly every time. I have some very expensive Sony noise cancelling headphones that can do this properly so that it works every time, so I know this is technically feasible, but that technology has trickled down to the inexpensive chipsets yet. So I am resigned to powering on and off a few times on occasion and messing with pairing on phone or computer to get it to work again.\n* The on/off slider is small and hard to work\n* No mute button, but then every inexpensive headset I have had with a mute button never worked properly with it in any app, so I guess I'm not missing much here.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is not the perfect headset for me, but I have decided it is good enough to meet my needs for now and I can live with the short comings.",
