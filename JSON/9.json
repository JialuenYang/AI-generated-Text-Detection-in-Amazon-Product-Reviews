			"body": "I really like Anker products. Everything that I've ever gotten from them has been very good. This charger is kinda bulky, but the the magnet sticks onto my phone very good. I have a magsafe case and this sticks on very well and I don't have to worry about it. It also charges pretty fast. All in all, I'm pretty happy about it. Very good",

			"title": "Honest Review After A Week Long Trip",
			"body": "I wanted to write an honest review of this charger after recently returning from a week-long trip for work - so from Sunday to Saturday. I recently got a Magsafe case and wanted to invest in a better portable charger when I do travel. I did a good bit of research and, honestly, there's a lot of competition out there with each charger sharing their own conflicting reviews. But, for the price of this charger and essentially what I wanted to use this for, I just went for it. And I'm not really disappointed.\n\nSo, I got this charger to use exclusively for travel. Not to use daily to help keep a charge on my phone throughout the day. I do have the iPhone 14 pro which, is relatively new to me, so the battery life on it is still good to where I really only charge my phone once a day (for a full charge). But, with traveling and having limited access to outlets, and using my phone constantly to check flights and emails, I wanted that backup. And really, chargers like this shouldn't be used as excessively as I've read some people to be using portable chargers. Especially when the portable charger itself doesn't have (as most do) the battery life and power to last all day. If your phone relies on life support (being plugged in all day), you should really consider a new phone. If you need an all-day battery, unfortunately, this isn't the charger for you. At that point, you need a really heavy-duty portable battery with a higher power capability.\n\nMy experience with this portable charger has actually been mostly positive. I tested it a day or so before my trip, and it took my phone from 50% to 80% in around an hour while charging the battery itself to its full life was around 2 hours. Something like this was perfect. Just something to kick up my phone's battery to a percentage I'm more comfortable with while on the plane or wherever. When I did travel for work, at one point I was able to get my phone from 40% to 70-80% within about 2 and a half hours, at least until I could actually plug my phone in and get a good full charge (note, I was also using my phone while it was charging. It probably could have charger quicker if I had not been using it).\n\nThe magnet also sticks to my phone very well. I have a magsafe case as well as an OhSnap popsocket that is magnetic itself, so the charger sticks super well and doesn't budge. It's very compact and even fits in a smaller purse I bring with me when I travel.\n\nThis charger, however, does get hot. But again, electronic devices will do this - especially if it's a battery working to charge your device. These things tend to not have fans like laptops and other larger electronics to avoid overheating. With my experience, when the battery does get hot - it actually sort of shuts itself off and waits until it's cool, which really takes only a couple of minutes. I have my actual phone protected by the case and popsocket, so I know the phone itself doesn't heat up too much with the battery. This really hasn't been too much of an issue for me. If I can feel it getting warm, I will take the battery off and let it cool for a minute or two, then pop it back on and it'll be cool enough to kick back on and continue charging my phone. This didn't happen the entire trip, only when I had it on for longer periods, like when I was on the plane listening to music and the like.\n\nAll in all. It's a decent portable charger that I will definitely be bringing with me on my travels. The quality already withstood a week of traveling with no damage or dip in its charging ability, so I have no doubt this will last me a good amount of time and become my travel go-to.",

			"body": "I like the strong magnet. It has a very strong hold. Charges my phone nicely and being able to put my AirPod Case on it is nice too. However, it seems I cannot charge the battery while I am trying to charge my watch at the same time. You can charge your phone and charge this battery simultaneously. That’s the only drawback that I don’t think is a big deal.",

			"body": "I recently purchased the Anker Magnetic Power Bank 10,000mAh, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with its performance. The MagSafe magnet feature works flawlessly, securely attaching my iPhone 15 Max for convenient charging on the go. The size of the charger is acceptable, making it easy to carry in my bag or pocket.\n\nHowever, I did notice that the wireless charging speed is not as fast as expected when charging my Samsung S23 Ultra. It charges my iPhone 15 Max adequately, but for those with high-powered devices, it may not provide the rapid charging they desire. Nonetheless, for its reliability and convenience, especially with the MagSafe magnet, I find this power bank to be a worthwhile investment.",

			"body": "The battery works well to charge the iPhone 15 pro max. The magsafe properties perform well to keep the battery attached to the phone. It is a little bulkier than I expected, which is more about my unrealistic expectations than the battery's actual size. It adds quite a bit of weight to the phone, so don't expect to want to carry it around attached to the phone. The case is somewhat slippery, and would benefit from surface textured grips on the sides to make it easier to hold onto when on the phone in use and when attaching and removing the battery. I'm not quite getting the battery life I expected. I'm getting about 1-1/2 charges between recharging. The magsafe battery does work to charge my phone when the charging cable is plugged in; however, the USB-A port does not operate when the charging cable is plugged in to the USB-C port. Not a big issue since I can plug a USB-C cable into the iPhone and use it as a charger while the battery recharges the iPhone.",

			"body": "Update… After my review was published, Anker reached out to me. Although this product, or at least the one I received, did not perform as expected. Anker did make it right. I still stand by what I originally said that Anker typically makes great products. Now I can also say that they stand behind their products.\n\nI love the size and weight of this item. And typically Anker has great products. Not this time. First, I ordered the green battery to match my phone. What I got is more like a pastel or Easter egg blue. As for charging, it is only capable of charging an iPhone 13pro about 30-40%. I have older, chunkier cheap 5000ah batteries that use a cord and can charge the phone at least twice. Given the size and weight, I seriously doubt this is a 5000ah battery.",
