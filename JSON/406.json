      "body": "As someone prone to temperature sensitivity from receding gums, I have struggled for years to find a toothpaste that whitens effectively yet gently. Several brands would initially whiten my teeth but cause aggravating pain that forced me to stop use. I'm thrilled to have finally discovered Sensodyne Pronamel as the solution!\n\nUnlike abrasive whitening toothpastes, this formulation adds protective barrier minerals back to vulnerable, exposed sections on my teeth prone to sensitivity. The novamin ingredient rebuilds the enamel's crystal surface from the inside out, permanently sealing off those painful holes without harsh bleaching chemicals.\n\nAfter just a few days of use, I noticed significantly less sharp zings when eating or drinking cold and hot foods. Even air currents lost their sting! Best of all, my smile continues looking noticeably brighter each day as the mineral-rich formula does its gradual whitening and protective strengthening magic.\n\nWith its specialized formula perfect for those with enamel issues, Sensodyne Pronamel promotes daily use without worry of irritation. Even as my gum line recedes further with age, this toothpaste keeps sensitivity and discomfort at bay as it gently polishes those pearly whites to a gorgeous glow. Smiling confidently again has done wonders for my self-esteem thanks to Pronamel.",
