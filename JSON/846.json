I'm happy with my purchase. It's super solid, simple to assemble, and looks great.\nWe do have the TV set on the lowest it can be set on the stand. There's a lot of room under there, so if someone has a sound bar or streaming box they need to keep underneath, then no worries, the clearance is plenty.\nThe swivel is a great feature in a room where one may sit in different chairs or need to adjust due to sunlight streaming through a window.\nThere were plenty of extra pieces for various sized/brands of televisions. It was no problem matching the correct screws to our TV, and now we have extras to put in our \"spare parts\" box for that \"I can use that one day\" mantra.",

Impressively well-written and illustrated instruction manual accompanies the wide array of hardware that makes this item capable of accommodating a wide range of TVs. Wide range of positioning options. We opted to position the TV near the upper range of vertical placements and it is still quite stable. Easy to rotate side to side without fearing it will topple off our furniture. Heavy 'black' glass base is nice touch. Worth the price.",

      "body": "UPDATE: My mistake on the \"does NOT tilt 8° up or at all. It DOES. Once I was finished with installing everything, including what I thought was the last step, and securing the tv in the stand, I stopped reading the instructions. The last step at the end of the instructions booklet shows you what to do to tilt the tv upward. I also mistakenly thought it could tilt DOWN as well-down was what I wanted, not up, by MY error. Perlgear responded via email almost immediately just from my review- I never contacted them directly- with an attached pic of the directions I ALREADY HAD. My mistake and excellent customer service by Perlegear! I LOVE THIS TV STAND!! Will be buying another for sure. First review: This was a very difficult 1 person (who's not mechanically inclined and physically disabled due to spine injury/surgeries) job, but doable. If I can do it, just about anyone can! I am VERY pleased with the result although I specifically chose the one with 35° side swing and 8° upward tilt. It does NOT tilt upward AT ALL. I can do without. DIRECTIONS(💯), screws/washers/wrench labeled/bagged separately was excellent and made what goes where easy to understand. Directions appeared to be done by one with English as their native language, big plus. If not for TCL covering the top 2 of 4 of the necessary holes with screws, wasting an hour on the phone with them to determine if my brand new TCL 50\" would work, it would've made it a MUCH shorter job than 2+hrs. I'm feeling the PAIN from having to do this alone, but you gotta do what you gotta do. I would like to personally thank those who had the great recommendation in Amazon Answers to lie the TV face down on a bed to attach it to the stand itself(as well as attaching the brackets to the back of the tv first). The final step of attaching the TV to the assembled stand was the most painful(again, for me) but was a quick part of all the steps thankfully. At just $29 with its sturdiness, excellent directions, items' identification, and finally its wonderful, flexible position for my new TV rather than those ridiculous wide fragile \"legs\" that come with the TV, are ALL reasons I HIGHLY recommend this or any Perlegear TV stand. I'll be buying another one to put my old 40something inch TCL that still works into another room now!",

Assembly was quick and easy.\nThe TV sits fine and the balance is good. So far I don't see any issues with the TV tipping over.\nMake sure your TV mounting holes are within the VESA patten (3.9x3.9 to 15.7x15.7inch). Most TVs should be fine. My TV was at the very outer limit of this spec. I had to use the very end holes in the mounting brackets, this was not a problem, everything lined up perfect.\nThe base is flat smooth glass 15.75x10.25inch\nThe swivel to turn the TV is easy to move.\nSome other reviews noted problems with the instructions. I had no issues, they were easy for me to follow.\nI am happy with this stand.",

I even was able to use the leftover washers and screws in another project. The setup was very fast and simple. After following the instructions for about 10-15 minutes I was done mounting my 37\" LCD. While it can tilt upwards, I just wish that it would tilt downwards too, but I haven't been able to find a stand like that, only wall mounts. I also wish I could adjust it a little lower too. But, other than that, I would highly recommend it. My TV is now sturdier than ever with this Perlegear stand. With the tempered glass base, it looks great too.",

I mounted this stand to a 50 inch TV and couldn't be more satisfied. It comes with all the screws and hardware for mounting it with a curved back or a flat back panel. The instructions are super easy to follow. After mounting my TV, I was surprised how lightweight it was after mounting it and it was rock solid, it's not going anywhere planted. The swivel and tilt on the stand are a bonus, will look for Perlegear TV stands in the future.....not going to go there but paid way too much for what I already have in comparison that does the same thing.",

The damaged glass is esthetically noticeable, it does not affect the purpose or strength of the stand. The stand is nearly as heavy as the TV. I am very happy with the mounting and flexibility of the stand and believe it to be the best product to meet my needs.

After looking around at various tv stands, I came across this one and decided to purchase it. The installation was pretty easy enough, though I suggest having a second pair of hands to help lift your tv, etc. I like that I can use my credenza now to have plants or books on it, and the stand is not noticable as I have my playstation 5 on the glass base so it kind of hides that I'm even using a stand. My neck is more comfortable when watching tv now that its at a higher position. It's pretty durable and sturdy, feels very secure.",
