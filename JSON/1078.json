      "body": "The Windshield Sun Shade designed for Tesla Model 3/Y cars has become an indispensable accessory, providing effective protection against the sun's intense rays and maintaining a cooler interior temperature.\n\nThe custom design tailored for Tesla Model 3/Y cars ensures a perfect fit. The shade covers the entire windshield, preventing direct sunlight from penetrating and heating up the cabin. This precision fit contributes to the shade's overall effectiveness.\n\nThe reflective material on the exterior of the sunshade acts as a barrier, deflecting sunlight and reducing heat absorption. This translates to a noticeably cooler interior when returning to the car on a hot day. The reflective surface also helps protect the car's dashboard and upholstery from sun damage.\n\nOne notable feature is the ease of installation. The sunshade unfolds and fits seamlessly into the windshield, and the foldable design allows for compact storage when not in use. The durability of the material ensures that the sunshade holds up well to regular use.\n\nOne standout experience was during a scorching summer day. After leaving the car parked for an extended period, the interior remained noticeably cooler compared to previous instances without the sunshade. This made re-entering the car a much more comfortable experience.",
