			"body": "I recently upgraded to the iPhone 14 and wanted to ensure its pristine display stayed protected. After trying out the Ailun Glass Screen Protector, I can confidently say it's a game-changer! This screen protector not only provides robust protection against scratches and daily wear and tear but also maintains the clarity and touch sensitivity of the original screen.\n\nThe installation process was a breeze, thanks to the precise cutouts and easy-to-follow instructions. I love how seamlessly it blends with my iPhone's design, giving it a sleek and professional look. The oleophobic coating is a fantastic addition, keeping fingerprints and smudges at bay, which is a huge plus for maintaining a clean and clear screen.\n\nWhat sets this screen protector apart is its durability. I've accidentally dropped my phone a couple of times, and each time, the Ailun protector has absorbed the impact, leaving my actual screen unscathed. This level of protection has given me peace of mind and saved me from potential costly screen repairs.\n\nOverall, if you want to protect your iPhone 14 while maintaining its original beauty and functionality, I highly recommend the Ailun Glass Screen Protector. It's a small investment that delivers big results, and I'm sure you'll be as impressed as I am!",

			"body": "These screen protectors are just perfect, exactly what i needed. Very good quality, arrived & functioned exactly as advertised, perfect fit for my Iphone 14 plus. I still cannot believe i got 3 for less than 10 bucks! The previous screen protector i had sucked. It was difficult to apply to my phone screen, pretty impossible to get it on without an air bubble or two stuck behind, got very cracked up & foggy in different areas within just 6 months or so, and was sold to me by the Verizon store (while purchasing my phone) for over $40 (for just 1 screen protector)!!!!! Which i am now pissed about! Needless to say, I’m extremely happy i found & bought these, which you just place on top of your screen & literally watch it self-attach like magic. I’m going to buy 2 more packs of 3 actually. I know if i do so, i can keep this phone for years and years without having to upgrade so often like most people sheepishly do, and that’s a really good feeling for me. Very very satisfied!",

The screen protector comes with 3 protectors which I thought I didn’t need but it really came in handy. The first screen protector I put on my phone ended up breaking for some reason that I can’t recall and then the second one broke as well. I am on my last screen protector of the pack. These screen protectors aren’t super durable in my experience since I have never dropped my phone from any height over 1 foot (30 cm). However, I see these as essential for any iPhone 14 user. It is better to have the screen protector than to not have it. These screen protectors are also super easy to apply.",

This is the second time purchasing these screen protectors and I can honestly say that they have done the job in keeping the screen safe from shattering. The price is great for a set of 3. You get to have extras in case another fall happens which is a huge plus. Shipping was so fast, I was able to get it the following day after ordering. I really recommend these protectors if you’re looking for something that will keep your screen from cracking. Sturdy and easy to install. Can’t beat this price!",

			"body": "I like the product, but it is not as easy to install as the video shows. We got two new iphone 15 pros. I got this screen protector because of the reviews and the installation video. But the install on both phone was not that easy. It did not completely seal done as the video shows, It left air bubbles underneath the protector. It took a lot of very hard pressing down with my thumb to get rid of the bubbles in both phones. If this had happened on only one phone, I would be OK with that as this might happen occasionally, but on both phones. I think this might be a common occurrence. So be advised. Although, I think overall, this is a good product for protecting the glass once you get it on. The install is why I gave it 3 stars.\nAs an edit to my previous rating, I'm increasing the rating to 4 stars. The bubbles that existed after the initial install, that I couldn't get out, have disappeared. The process of completely sealing the glass just took more time than the video showed.",

			"title": "Worst Screen Protector!",
			"body": "I’ve been using screen protectors for my phones for over 10 years and I’ve never had one be so poor that it legitimately cracked my actual phone screen!!\n\nLet’s start by saying I do drop my phone a decent amount because I live a pretty active lifestyle! I always keep my phone in a case and have my screen protected because I know how I am! By no means am I intentionally dropping/throwing my phone or dropping it from great heights etc.\n\nI bought this set of 3 in June 2023 to replaced my old cracked tempered glass screen protector. I had generally bought expensive ones but this had good reviews and I wanted to try and save money because when comparing what I had it seemed almost identical!\nAfter replacing my old screen protector with one from this set I proceeded to notice I had more trouble than ever putting it on. It didn’t seem to line up or lay flat. My phone was less than a year old and had no cracks so I assumed I was the problem. (Note: I followed all instructions and kept everything CLEAN.) I wasn’t sure why I couldn’t get at least one of the dime sized bubbles out no matter how hard I tried and eventually had to accept it.\nI don’t remember exactly how long it took before I dropped my phone but the very first drop my screen protector cracked. I kept that particular screen protector on for a little while (dropped a few times after and the cracks only got worse which is when I always change protectors.) I replaced that broken screen protector for a second one in that set. The same exact thing happened with it not fitting properly! I had it out of my case etc. to put it on and there was no reason it wasn’t fitting! (I almost threw the entire screen protector out and tried a new one!) One edge had crumbled on the first screen protector so I ordered a new phone case prior to putting the second screen protector on thinking maybe that was the issue. (It wasn’t.) Within a few days I dropped my phone and the screen again cracked and after a couple months or less it also shattered and chipped just like the other one.\nEventually the fact I couldn’t see my actual phone screen because of the lifting drove me so crazy I took it off with intentions of replacing screen protector two with screen protector three of the set and while prepping my phone I realized the crack and shattering/crumbling of the glass wasn’t just the screen protector it was my actual phone screen!!\n\nMy phone NEVER ONCE fell out of my phone case etc. the edges of my phone are covered by my case and I’ve used the same type of phone case (same brand and/or style just a different size/model) for probably 8 years or more and I’ve never had an issue with my actual phone screen (not screen protector) getting cracked/damaged!\n\nNow it’s February 2024 and I just put screen protector number three on for the time being. The funniest/weirdest part is the screen protector actually fits better now that my screen is cracked. It took me over 15 minutes to get it to line up “properly” and I have the least amount of bubbles yet but I don’t know how long that will last since I have a crack starting from the edge (where my screen crumbled from what I believe was the screen protector crumbling into my screen) all the way through the long distance of my screen to the other edge of where the screen protector stopped. (Not my screen, the screen protector because the thing doesn’t cover the entire screen like it should)\n\nAnd to make things more annoying this screen protector doesn’t even cover my front camera like the original one I bought these to replace. Honestly it’s probably a blessing since my phone cracked where the screen protector was.\nThe front facing camera was my biggest concern when I received these screen protectors because I was so worried it would get cracked being exposed but now its proof to me that the screen protector was what damaged my screen.\n\nSo in my opinion it’s better to pay a little extra because this will definitely cost me more in the long run!\nI already contacted the company but it is a little annoying Amazon doesn’t offer any help other than giving you the website of the company. I had already found that and additional info on my own before even looking into Amazon’s customer service options. Amazon didn’t even offer me a direct communication option with the company just a link to go figure it out myself and hope the company gets back to you. I’ve seen that a lot in the past with Amazon and that’s how I knew to contact the company before checking Amazon. I understand but also it’s slightly disappointing Amazon doesn’t have more options to help their customers and keep companies they partner with accountable.",

I was also very disappointed that the very fist time I dropped my phone (less than a week after putting the screen protector on) it cracked the screen protector.

They have all been bone dry. Not detrimental to the function of the screen protector, just mildly annoying that I’m anticipating a wet wipe to clean my screen and it’s just another dry wipe",
