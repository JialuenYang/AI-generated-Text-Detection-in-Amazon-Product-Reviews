			"title": "Loving this Bluetooth Speaker!",
			"body": "I really like this speaker. It has some great features such as automatic shut-off if you disable Bluetooth for any length of time. I am a remote worker so I use my headphones a lot for web conferencing. During this time I need to disable the Anker speaker. When I do that, after a while the speaker power turns off, which is a great battery saver.\n\nI like the size and weight, which is hefty and spells \"durable\" to me.\n\n**\nMarch 24, 2024 Update:\n\nI have learned that I can use the Anker speaker with my headphones on. The speaker captures the audio on my conference calls, giving a lot of headroom to increase the volume of the people talking. Simultaneously, through my headphone speaker, I can speak and be heard on my conference call.\n\nFurther -- I liked this so much, I bought a second one. This way I can have continuous music and audio even when one unit needs to be recharged. I had to add the second Anker speaker as a separate device in my Windows 10 Bluetooth settings, but after I did that, I was able to swap the speaker out immediately, giving me continuous audio.\n\nOne of my favorite possessions that I use constantly. Great job Anker!\n\n*UPDATE!\nAs a remote worker, when I am on conference calls with my headphones on (so I can use my microphone), I leave this Anker speaker connected, and it gives me even more volume than I can get on my headphones. This has been useful more than once when different speakers have very low volume and I can't hear them. And it doesn't cause any feedback through my microphone either. Another reason to love this speaker!!!\n\nThe wireless connectivity also frees up a USB port on my PC. USB ports are in short supply given all the devices I need to attach to my PC.\n\nThe sound is just OK, but I don't expect much from a small speaker.\n\nI found it relatively easy to connect it to my PC and my phone using Bluetooth, unlike some other Bluetooth devices I have purchased. This includes a different wireless speaker I purchased off Amazon, whose brand name escapes me right now. I sent that one back in favor of the Anker.\n\nHighly recommended!!!",

			"body": "You want a review? Here's a review!\n\nTalk about a damn good speaker for the price. You can't beat this value. I actually hear bass! I've had my speaker for a wee lil bit over 2 years now. So trust this is a proper review. If a reviewer got it, and it was broken immediately or shortly thereafter, yes, that says something about overall quality, but unfortunately, no matter the product lemons occur. Those reviews are totally helpful, but you have to weigh them against other reviews that may be more positive. And no, I'm not being paid for this review. I just feel that the more information provided on a product the best for all - consumers, manufacturers, and sellers. That being said...let's get down to the nitty gritty.\n\nPrice - done and done, son. You can beat this price. Even without looking at quality, <$30 for a portable speaker is damn proper. Usually, at this price, I'm thinking, \"How much treble am I gonna have?\" Yes \"treble\" bc for most low end speakers that's all you get - treble, and then, bass that is the equivalent to a soft unsatisfied grunt.\n\nCharge - The charge does last a long time. However, I can now tell that the time between charges is shorter now. And in the past 2 months I've noticed that I can have it charging, not in use for a long time, but the blue light that indicates that the speaker is fully charged never goes on. This did bother me when it first started happening, but I now see that I still have a lot of play/usage time despite not having the blue light fully charged special.. Definitely 12+ hrs.\n\nI cannot say exactly how much use time I get. I don't keep the speaker in use for more than 5ish+ hrs most days. But I do notice the frequency of charge. And now, after 2 years and many, many, many days leaving the speaker on, not plugged in, not in use (for days), I will have to charge it once during the weekend. That's the time I use it the most and when it might be in use for 8+ hrs.\n\nPersonally, it's not a bother since I can charge and use the speaker at the same time. However, if you're going on a weekend camping trip, especially if you've had the speaker for a while, definitely take a power source or an additional speaker. I'm planning on getting another for that same reason - one for home and one for travel.\n\nSound Quality - As I mentioned earlier, for a portable speaker, the bass is quite decent, as is the volume. I've had house parties using only this speaker and it was perfect. Now, I do only have a 2/1 apt, but on the balcony and even on the yard (if strategically placed) all guests were able to hear the music. Yet, it's not too loud to cause a disturbance. We've been hanging out till 6-7am, with the speaker on the balcony, without any complaints. Volume: Distubance = on point!\n\nSet-up/Use - The set up is über simple. And you can easily disconnect and pair the speaker to another device. As more an more devices become simpler to pair, this is not as an important feature, but still one to note. KIS - keep it simple.\n\nNot so short summary that is longer than the review - Hands down this is the best speaker for your money and better than many other higher priced speakers out there. I almost bought a Beats Pill, but decided against it after comparing price and reviews to Anker's portable speaker. And I decided, quite definitively, yes, Anker's portable speaker is worth it.\n\nFor a fraction of the price for Beats I encourage you to try it out. Especially make the leap if you are looking for a travel speaker. Because when you travel, things never go as planned and inevitably something goes to crap like - your trip itinerary, your luggage, shady hostels inspired by or the inspiration of an Eli Roth flick, lost chonies (look it up bc the \"p\" word is gross, girls wear those, and I'm a grown woman and I wear chonies/chones), lost passports, lost virginities (the plural includes one virginity for multiple individuals or multiple virginities per one individual - like if you grew a second hymen or are a born again virgin), lost souls (it happens), or even the loss of dignity. But through all of that, what really blows is the loss of a hundreds of dollars speaker that you purchased mainly for your travel.\n\nIf you get the Anker Soundcore, will you be protected from the aforementioned b.s.? Not in the slightest. But will you loathe yourself less when your bad ass portable speaker with 24hr charge is lost? Yes bc you didn't spend a few Benjamins on it.So now you can get a replacement. Or better yet, go ahead and buy 2 now and save yourself the hassle (but indulge in the Hasselhoff).\n\nMoral of the story. Stop reading reviews right meow and get this speaker. It's good, it's a fraction of the cost of comparable speakers, the charge lasts forever (if your forever was 24 hrs or less), you can charge it and still use it, and does this look like a face that would lie to you? Exactly! Also you can use the speaker, connected to your Alexa decide to play music by the Hoff, without a hassle (you see why I did there).\n\nEpilogue: On a side note, I'm currently debating getting this model (which I've had for two years, just reminding you in case you forgot or were distracted by to sweet tunage of the Hoff playing in your mind since you ahvent bought this speaker yet -Shame, shame, SHAME!), or the updated version. I've been pretty darn pleased with the older model. So that should also tell you something - the older model is so dope that I don't even know if I need the newer version.",

			"title": "There is nothing better than sitting on the beach with a cold beer ...",
			"body": "Since this is the first real review I’m doing I’m not really sure where to start. I’ve been wanting a Bluetooth speaker for a while now. With a trip to the beach coming up I decided it was time to pull the trigger. There is nothing better than sitting on the beach with a cold beer and listening to good music. I am the type of person who likes good sound quality and that is going to be the number one thing I look for before I consider aesthetics or brand. There is an exception here – budget.\n\nWhen I first came across the Anker SoundCore on Amazon I was skeptical mostly because of the $35 price point. The next speaker I consider was the JBL Clip 2. The JBL did satisfy a requirement I had which was to be waterproof. However I decided that sacrificing this to save a little cash. Another deciding factor was the reviews that I read on Amazon. While one reviewer (krwhome) did a comparison of the JBL Flip 3 speaker to the Anker. Their initial observation was higher sound quality with the JBL (as I would expect). However after further testing they edited the review to state that the Bluetooth range on the SoundCore was superior. This is a bonus for me so I went with the Anker. Full disclosure – I have not been able to test this claim so I’m taking their word for it. I have been using it for several days without a recharge simply cutting it off when not in used. Very impressed with the battery life so far.\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n\nThe packaging is very nice. Everything has its place and no space is wasted. There is just enough room for the speaker and charging cable with a small manual (who needs those things anyway?). The design of the speaker is very satisfying. I like how simple and sleek it is. The logo on the front is a really cool touch to me. It literally takes up a large portion of the front but still manages to not be overstated or obnoxious. If anything it really adds something to the look in my opinion. Some things I did not notice when shopping for the speaker are that it has a 3.5mm aux plug on the side as well as a microphone. For me this is a nice surprise since I wasn’t expecting it. I never really thought of using it for making calls or using the Google Assistant but that definitely makes it even more useful! The buttons on the top are responsive. I do like that they are the same color so it doesn’t take away from the sleek look but my initial impression was that this may make them harder to distinguish after a few beers. After handling the speaker it has a very dense sturdy feel. Overall my initial impression of the Anker SoundCore is very positive.\n\nTesting & Use:\n\nRight out of the box pairing with my Samsung S8 was very quick and simple. Right when it powered on the blue LED on the front was flashing. Almost immediately it showed up on the phone and paired right up. The LED is solid once paired. First thing I did was fired up Amazon Unlimited Music and listened to the new Imagine Dragons album in an effort to test the range and see how good the lows are. The highs sound great and overall sound quality is very good. The lows do leave a little to be desired in my opinion. Though I wouldn’t really hold it against the speaker due to its size and price point. The lows are At the time of this review I see a new model (Anker SoundCore 2) has been released and it advertises better base and 66ft Bluetooth range. The price is only a little higher at $45.99 it would be worth a try but I’m still very happy with the original SoundCore.\n\nThe call quality was decent on both calls I made in testing. I don’t really have a baseline here but compared to the speakerphone on my S8 it is similar. Callers reported a little better microphone quality from the S8 as I would expect. However they had no complaints when talking through the SoundCore. Testing outdoors on the patio by the pool as well as on the beach was very impressive. The volume is plenty for several people to enjoy and adjusting is easy thanks to the large pronounced buttons on the top. One thing to keep in mind is the fact that it is not waterproof or water resistant. So if you’re taking this to the pool or beach as I am keep it safe!\n\nThe battery life thus far has been fantastic. I’ve listened for several hours at a time and not had it go dead on me. They advertise 24 hour battery life. I have not put this to the test but have no reason to doubt it is obtainable at a reasonable volume. I don’t have a lot of negatives for the SoundCore. If the volume is up to maximum and you press the volume up button it has a very loud beep to let you know you’re as high as you can go. It is in my opinion an obnoxious beep but I understand it’s purpose and don’t see a point in docking points for that. The very first time I connected to the SoundCore I was testing the and went a couple rooms over to see how well it would pick up. Once I got 25 or 30 feet away it began to break up some but bear in mind this was through several walls as well. The thing that initially concerned me was that it did not reconnect once I came back into range. Instead the blue LED was back to flashing but when I selected the devices in my S8 Bluetooth menu it never would connect. Since then I have re-paired with the device and gotten out of range several times and it reconnected just like it should. I’ve tried several scenarios and been unable to reproduce the problem at all.\n\nTo sum it all up I’m sitting here listening to some music with my lady writing this review and I am very happy with my purchase. If you’re budget-conscious and want a quality Bluetooth speaker you can’t go wrong with the Anker SoundCore.",

			"body": "This is one powerful speaker to be so small. The sound quality is great, even when turned up or isn't distorted. Great bass, and fantastic battery life.\nI've had this for awhile now and didn't want to leave a review until I had a chance to use them, and see how well they performed over time. They're solid too. I dropped it a couple of times and that had no effect on it. It got scratched up a bit, but still worked and sounded the way its supposed to.\nI was so impressed, I bought two more. Reason being, you can connect the speakers to each other, place them wherever you want for a surround sound like effect. It's really cool.\nTo show how loud they can get, I had a get together with about 15 or so people. With just two speakers going, they were so loud I actually had to turn them down a little.\nI have no problem in recommending this speaker. The battery life is great, you can connect them together, and the sound is great!!!!",

			"title": "One of the best I've had.",
			"body": "The other two people that I live with both work on Fridays, so I use that time to deep clean, do my laundry, do meal prep for the week, do light work on my laptop, etc and I love listening to my music while moving around my house doing these. My phone speaker is kind of trash and my computer speaker, somehow, is even worse than my phone, so I decided to buy a speaker.\n\nBuy this speaker. If you're considering buying it, don't worry about anything else and buy this speaker.\n\nPros:\n1) Very fast when it comes to connecting. Even when connecting it for the first time, it's very quick to sync with my phone and laptop and is able to switch the audio with minimal delay. In addition, it's fast to boot up and shut down.\n2) The sound. Excellent. Usually with most speakers that cost less than 50 dollars would give you that gross disjointed, rattling sound when you turn them on full blast, but this speaker doesn't. It's quite loud as well; I'm able to hear it from all the way across my house and even a little bit outside when on full blast (though my walls are kind of thin and I don't blast my music enough for a public disturbance.) As expected, it sounds best on a low-mid volume, but it doesn't make much of any difference to the audio quality when it's on full volume. I could listen to Video Game OST's and Rock music all day on this thing.\n3) Overall design. The size is good for its power, not too big, not too small. The design is simple and minimalistic, and I like that the buttons are textured. The rectangular shape isn't my cup of tea, but I usually put it on my desk or on my kitchen counter and go on with about my day so it's something you can get over quickly. It's light and easy to move around as well. I've dropped it a few times on accident on hard tile floors, and it hasn't broken or damaged anything either.\n4) Battery life. I've only used it for maybe 2-4 hours every now and then since I bought it and I haven't had to charge it yet. It came to me fully charged and it's really nice that I don't have to charge it every two hours like other speakers.\n\nCons:\n1) Bass. The bass itself is great, though I mean more like, wall-rattling, bring-this-to-a-friends-house bass. This isn't that kind of speaker. Now, it would be nice for a little private outing with some buds at a picnic or watching a movie outside and such, but don't bring this to a house party and expect a mosh pit, ya know? It's loud, but not like that. Personally, I don't mind the bass so this is for other people to consider.\n2) No fast-forwards/rewind option. Speaker has a power button, volume up and down button, play/pause button, and a bluetooth button but that's kind of it. A little inconvenient when I'm a bit away from my phone and want to change/rewind the song. Would really like if you could press the play button twice or three times to fast-forward at the least, but that's all.\n\nTLDR;\nThis is a great speaker for a decent price. If you're cheap and have second thoughts about the price, this speaker is very much worth it. Great sound that is able to get loud without messing with the audio quality, excellent battery life, and fast when syncing. Not the best speaker for a house party if that's your kind of thing. Overall, 9.5/10.",

			"title": "3 Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speakers Tested",
			"body": "We were looking for a relatively inexpensive portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to replace a fun –looking Big Lots “boom box” style speaker that lasted for about a year. Our primary use is for streaming music or internet radio services such as Pandora and Spotify, and listening by the pool and while having dinner.\nMy wife and I decided to take a listen to 3 highly reviewed speakers that received mostly positive reviews on Amazon. Here are the 3 speakers tested:\n1. Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 (Cost: $27.99)\n2. Anker SoundCore (Cost: $35.99)\n3. JBL Flip 3 Splashproof ($81.30)\n\nWe were really hoping that the less expensive speakers would have been close in sound quality to the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof. Sadly,that just wasn’t the case. Upon the very first look, when opening up the box, you get a sense that Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 is a very no-frills, inexpensive speaker. The packaging, the speaker, the extremely short, tiny USB charging cable. Visually speaking, this speaker screamed no-frills.\n\nConversely, the Anker SoundCore gave the impression that you were opening up a well-constructed, tiny speaker. It was packaged nicely, easy instructions, it felt a lot more substantial than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3. Aditionally, the USB charging cable looked like your average size charging cable for your portable devices.\n\nLast, was the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof. At $81.30, it was a lot more money than we were hoping to spend on a portable pool speaker. It was plain to see that this speaker just looked “ more expensive” than the other two models. Great packaging, a super long and thick USB charging cable that came in an eye-catching orange colored jacket. The speaker itself looked awesome too with its compact cylinder shape.\n\nEnough about the appearance… a speaker is all about ease of use and more importantly -- how it sounds. How did all 3 sound and how easy were they to use?\n\nOn all 3 speakers in our test, we used 3 separate Samsung Galaxy 7s phones. We played the same identical songs on each speaker and set the volume identical on all 3 phones. Here were our results-\n\n1. Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3. Unfortunately, this speaker was the least inspiring of the three speakers. The sound was clear. However, it sounded tiny, none to very little bass. It projected a rather flat sound with the various music we played through it. It was though extremely easy to use, and the Bluetooth worked flawlessly. I would generously give it 3 Stars. On sound alone, I’d say it’s more 2 Stars.\n2. Anker SoundCore – This speaker was hands-down better than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 for just a few dollars more. Lots of great features – all of which worked perfectly. The only downside of the Anker SoundCore was that it lacked bass. The sound coming out of the Anker SoundCore is very balanced and fairly loud for such a small speaker. I would lean more towards the 4 Star mark on the Anker SoundCore simply for delivering a very nice, balanced sound quality, and is capable of filling a small room.\n3. JBL Flip 3 Splashproof – At $81.30, we were really hoping that this wouldn’t be a situation where “you get what you pay for”. Unfortunately, it was in the end. Regardless of the song, or the type of music we played through it, it was far superior to the other two speakers. It worked flawlessly and the sound/projection of sound coming out blew away the other speakers. The Flip 3 Splashproof produced a rich, full sound that was extremely clear and thumped just the right amount of bass. It easily fills space with great clarity.\n\nAll-in-all, the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof blew away this competition. 5 Stars. If you’re on a tight budget, you can’t go wrong with the Anker SoundCore. If you can swing the extra bucks for the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof – go for it! It sounds amazing!\n\nUpdate: Even though the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof sounds very good, the Bluetooth range is awful. As long as your phone is within a very short distance of this speaker you will be happy. The Bluetooth range on the Anker is WAY better than the JBL.",

			"title": "USPS LLV Comparison: OontZ Angle 3 Plus vs Anker SoundCore",
			"body": "First off, I am not an audiophile. This is a review from a simple person who wanted music at work.\n\nI am a Rural Carrier for the United Stated Postal Service. I deliver mail in an LLV truck and these vehicles are basically mobile tin cans. Every panel rattles, making for quite an unpleasant environment, audio wise. I tried playing music directly off my phone, but alas my speakerphone is only so loud and is constantly drowned out by the LLV.\n\nSo, I researched Bluetooth speakers and, based on the reviews and popularity, recently purchased two:\n- Anker SoundCore Bluetooth Speaker with 24-Hour Playtime, 66-Foot Bluetooth Range & Built-in Mic, Dual-Driver Portable Wireless Speaker with Low Harmonic Distortion and Superior Sound - Black\n- OontZ Angle 3 PLUS Splashproof Bluetooth Speaker - Designed & Engineered by Cambridge SoundWorks for Richer Bass, HD Sound, and 30-Hour Playtime, 10W+ Power, Water Resistant, Portable Wireless Speaker\n\nThe Anker SoundCore is being returned while I am keeping the OontZ Angle 3 Plus and here is why.\n\nI tested both speakers in my home at first. My very first impression, out of the box:\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - was nice to touch and just felt solid and very well built.\nAnker SoundCore - just felt like a simple lightweight brick. It really didn't give the impression of longevity or durability.\n\nThe set-up guides were quite different from each other.\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - Extremely easy to read, follow and understand (remember, I am not a music nut lol. This was my first time ever using a Bluetooth speaker and was in completely uncharted territory.) It was all in English, and only English and the diagrams were detailed and made the entire set-up process seamless and carefree.\nAnker SoundCore - This guide was very hard to follow. It is printed in darn near every language, in tiny print and the diagrams were quite small as well. I ultimately did get the speaker paired with my phone and figured out what buttons did what, but it took nearly 15 minutes to do so.\n\nBluetooth Pairing\nWith both speakers and my phone lined up on a table (well within the proximity specified in each set-up guide), both speakers paired, however:\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - MUCH faster in pairing (mere seconds!).\nAnker SoundCore - took nearly two minutes to complete the pairing process.\n\nPause/Play Button\nSince I dismount to deliver packages to a customer's door routinely on my route, I really need to have a simply way to pause my music. I really like how both speakers offer this function on directly on the units, saving me from having to handle my phone.\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - I barely press the Play/Pause button and the speaker immediately reacts. There is NO hesitation.\nAnker SoundCore - I press the Play/Pause button and there is a delay of about 5 seconds.. just long enough to make me think I didn't press hard enough and reach to do it again only for the speaker to finally react.\n\nVolume/Overall Playback Quality\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - Wow. Just wow. It is truly unbelievable to hear such full sound, and bass(!), coming from such a small unit. I found myself perfectly pleased with the output without ever reaching max volume on the speaker itself. So I am looking forward to how well it will work in my LLV during my first road test. As for now, I am thoroughly impressed!\nAnker SoundCore - I maxed out the volume on my phone and the speaker and was just not impressed. If I could guess, I'd say the max output this speaker achieved was only about 25% more than my speakerphone alone (while the OontZ Angle 3 Plus blew it out of the water with close to double, if not more, output than my speakerphone alone).\nI also noted some kind of distortion or interference type background sound with the Anker SoundCore at mid volume and above.\n\nSpeakerphone/Mic\nI was able to answer an incoming phone call on both units as described in each set-up guide. The quality of in-call sound on each speaker differed:\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - My husband's (the caller) voice was crisp and clear, as if he was sitting talking right next to me. There was no distortion or feedback out of the speaker. Husband reported nothing but a clear voice on his phone.\nAnker SoundCore - Husband's voice was clear, but echoed horribly. No matter what volume level I used. There was no distortion (I was expecting this given the distortion with the music playback) bu the continuous echoing is a major issue for me. Husband reported a slight \"faded\" type of echo on his phone.\n\nRoad Test (in my LLV)\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - The sound is amazing in the truck! Thinking I would need it, I maxed the volume on both the speaker and my phone then pressed play on my music. Well, I certainly don't need max volume. I reduced the volume on both the speaker and my phone and found a very happy medium output. This speaker performs perfectly in the loud, rattling setting of a USPS LLV.. even while bouncing down rural dirt two tracks and washboard gravel roads. I am extremely pleased with this tiny speaker.\nAnker Soundcore - Even with maxed volume settings, I could not get this speaker to perform anywhere near as well as the OontZ Angle 3 Plus. It had volume and was loud enough to hear over the vehicle's own noise, however the distortion/interference mentioned earlier was still present and in the truck during the road test it had what I would describe as an echoing effect on the music, specifically the singers' voices. It just wasn't clear. (I hope that makes sense.)\n\nBattery Life/Listen While Charging\nOontZ Angle 3 Plus - So far, the battery life is impressive. After receiving it, I charged it overnight (as recommended). I then had it connected to my phone for about an hour of home testing. Turned it off and I next used it at work on a Saturday.. had it powered on and connected to my phone and actively playing music for about 5.5 hours. I then used it again on Monday (much longer and busier days in the USPS, FYI).. had it on, connected and active continuously for nearly 9 hours. I have yet to see the low battery light come on. I plan to see just how many days of work I can get out of a single charge.\nAnker Soundcore - I have no information for this section on this speaker since I am returning it.\n\nExterior/Cleaning\nAt first, I had the OontZ Angle 3 Plus setting on the dashboard of the LLV. This didn't last more than two stops. Despite having the four rubber \"feet\", the speaker still slid around causing more of a distraction than I would like. I ended up setting it on top of my personal bag, in a bin by my feet with the speaker facing up. This move really helped my piece of mind, knowing it will not go anywhere. This speaker has a soft rubber exterior. It is quite nice and feels luxurious, however... this exterior attracts all dust particles within 50 feet! USPS LLVs are *not* known for being the cleanest and even though I moved the speaker from the dust-ridden dashboard to a bin, it was still slathered with dust and dirt by the end of my route. I figured it was a fair trade, sacrificing the appearance for the gain of having decent music. But.. I got home and went to clean it. I will tell you, my expectations of this working were very low. I didn't think the dust would come off that supple rubber. But with a wet paper towel and a few slow wipes, it did. So, it can be cleaned up!\n\nCase\nI did purchase the case for this speaker ( [Official] OontZ Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth Portable Speaker Carry Case, Neoprene with Aluminum Carabiner, reinforced zipper, by Cambridge SoundWorks [NOT FOR OontZ Angle 3 ]). I was mainly wanting a safe way to transport and store the speaker, but after reading the other reviews I was hoping I would be able to keep it clean in the case and still enjoy my music on my route. I received the case and used it yesterday. The case is extremely nice and I appreciate the interior mesh pocket. I have no need for it now, but I'm sure it will come in handy if I ever take this speaker on vacation and need to take the charging cables along. As for playback while in the case? Yeah, it was terribly muffled. It didn't work for me as it apparently has for others. Yet, the case itself is exactly what I was wanting for taking it to and from work. It is not as thickly padded as I would have expected, however it does protect the speaker.\n\nOverall, for my specific purpose and intended use for a Bluetooth speaker, the Anker SoundCore simply won't cut it. However, it is still a nice speaker and will perhaps fit your needs perfectly. After all, most people don't drive LLVs and have the same high demands that go along with that. For me, the OontZ Angle 3 Plus is what I'll be bopping down the road to, mailbox to mailbox.\n\nHappy hunting! Hope this review helps you out!",

			"body": "I have only had this speaker for one day so far, so if the thing breaks prematurely I will definitely be changing my review in the future!\n\nHowever, for the price, this is a great speaker! The bluetooth set up was as easy as a few clicks. It worked straight away. I was able to take the speaker around with me while I did chores in my house and it was connecting from far away. I think for a tiny speaker and for something on the cheap side, the sound quality is amazing.\n\nI listened to a couple songs on it and I think it sounds really great. If you think the speaker sounds bad it could be the quality of the recording or file that you are listing to. Of course a Bose or something is going to sound better, but if I want audiophile-grade audio then I'm not messing around with a Bluetooth speaker, lol. However I just want this to listen to podcasts and videos while I work in my house and outside and it's perfect!\n\nI am really happy I got this speaker!!! But I'm also traumatized by electronic devices these days. I have wasted a lot of money buying electronics that break after a few months and can't be returned... especially here on Amazon! So if this product is one of those I will be back to let you know 😂",

			"body": "First, the pairing was simple and worked flawlessly. Second, the sound is great! Third, I would have paid more for them if I knew how good they were. Fourth, this is a review after having them for less than a week, I think. Fifth, I bought a famous name brand that I have known for more than three decades for the same price. They were on sale and are not as sturdy as these. They would just stop working in the middle of a song. Turns out it was a speaker issue as I found out later when I went to read the reviews on the website-- that I DID NOT read before I purchased them. SMDH.\n\nLast, the last good waterproof speakers I had were MIFAs. They no longer sell that particular speaker or I would have re-purchased them. These are as good or better as the speakers I use with my MP3 player, actually a phone I purchased just for that. LOL. Also, I purchased them as a recommendation that few purchasers send them back. I HATE WHEN STUFF DOESN'T WORK AND I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK!\n\nI'll check back a year later if they stop working due to no issue caused by me. I tend to play my music loudly. LOL.",

			"body": "I know nothing about technology and had never connected anything to Bluetooth till this Anker speaker arrived. I plunged in without reading the instructions, made a couple of mistakes -- but in the end I declared my efforts a victory!\n\nIt looks kind of clunky but I'll find a better spot for it eventually.\n\nThe important part: it works just like I had hoped it would. My problem was an old and now-discontinued Echo Flex I plugged in behind my sofa. Trouble is, the sofa is so cushy (absorbing sound) and my TV is so loud, Alex's answers to my inquiries were impossible to hear. I had nowhere else to put the Flex so I had to find a way to hear Alexa's responses. This swell speaker delivers them loud and clear.\n\nI don't know yet how well the battery will perform (did the first charge yesterday and will not be using it to play music...just the occasional interaction with Alexa, so I expect the charge to last a long time). The included charging cable would be a LOT better if it were longer and if the part that plugs into the speaker wasn't so hard to disconnect. I'm old and weak, so maybe it was worse for me than it would be for others, but I had to use all my strength. I also wish there was an ordinary plug (the kind for an ordinary outlet) on the other end. Had to charge it via my laptop which was not very convenient because I was using it at the time, and had to move both items whenever I set the laptop aside.\n\nUPDATE: I bought a longer cord and a wall outlet adapter -- both work great -- so now everything is perfect. And I did find a better place for the speaker :)",

			"title": "Stupid micro-usb charger port without a cover...",
			"body": "Basically this is a great speaker, no cover for the aux & charger, plus the charger port being micro-usb, lastly there is no carry strap, these are the flaws. It's a lightweight, super loud, clear as can be, has decent bass, and it's the cheapest, a lot of pros going for it. I need a beach speaker, I fear this would fail me. The SoundCore 2 makes some improvements but the weight jumps up and it still has micro-usb port at $40 so I'd just use the Tribit MaxSound Plus at $50 if weight wasn't a factor. Eduplink M6 was a great advertisement Amazon randomly sent me because I will be keeping that no name brand over the 2 I originally thought would be my beach speaker.\n\nIf the beach wasn't my prime use for this speaker and say camping was, I may keep this speaker, it's the cheapest of all 4 I bought. It's not the loudest, but it's definitely loud enough, the sound clarity is phenomenal, bass is just decent. If heavy bass is your absolute must have, grab the Tribit MaxSound Plus and call it a day. I really wanted this to be my speaker because the 2nd most popular review took the cover off and spray painted it, I so wanted that look. But having to put tape over the ports everyday isn't going to happen my friend. I want something that will be reliable in the sand. You may say sit it on the towel, but alas I have 2 kids, you're kidding yourself if you don't think this thing will be kicked into the sand.\n\nI compared Tribit XSound Go ($31) vs Tribit MaxSound Plus ($50) vs Eduplink M6 ($31), Anker SoundCore ($28). All 4 had a deal, both Tribits & Anker had a coupon and the M6 was on a lightning deal.\n\nThe M6 punches far above it's weight class. After watch numerous YouTube videos on the MaxSound Plus I thought for sure it would be perfect, Anker is also mentioned a lot of times understandably so, it's a fantastic speaker.\n\nMaxSound Plus is far superior to the XSound Go, now the MaxSound Plus is almost twice the price. But it feels only slightly heavier than the Go, and only slightly larger. If you need the speaker to be smaller I'd recommend looking into the very small options out there. The bass boost and audiobook options on the MaxSound Plus make the sound quality shine compared to the XSound Go.\n\nEduplink M6 is a 360° speaker so comparing to Tribits Stormbox ($100+) would be better but the M6 is priced around XSound Go. The sound isn't as clear as the Tribit MaxSound Plus. The bass also doesn't compare to MaxSound Plus which has bass boost capabilities. The M6 is far lighter than either of the Tribit speakers by far, about the same weight as the Anker SoundCore. About half the weight of the MaxSound. But it is slightly bigger than the MaxSound, I think the Anker SoundCore would be about the same size as the Tribit XSound Go but I already returned it so only an estimate.\n\n-XSound Go was the smallest of these 3 speakers side by side, Anker very comparable in size.\n-MaxSound Plus is the loudest\n-MaxSound Plus has the most clarity\n-Anker sounds fantastic, it's no MaxSound Plus, but it's half the weight and smaller.\n-M6 will float, Anker also is supposed to float but not drivers up.\n-M6 is 360° so it sounds the same on every side\n-M6 has RGB lighting effects \"party lights\"\n-M6 arrived with a cosmetic defect\n-Anker does NOT have a cover for the charger port, only 1 with the old micro-USB cable\n-Tribit and Eduplink all have a cover for the charge port, USB-C\n-Tribit cover is easier to open, better design\n-All 4 have auxiliary port, all but Anker came with Aux cord.\n-All 4 say 20+ hours of battery life. It took me 3 days to drain the MaxSound Plus.\n\nI'm leaning towards keeping the Eduplink M6 because I need a beach speaker. The XSound Go doesn't stand a chance in this race. Anker SoundCore would be a top contender IF it had a cover on the charger port. The real comparison is between M6 and MaxSound Plus.\nBoth are plenty loud enough, MaxSound Plus has better clarity and much better bass. The M6 feels half the weight, the woven material on the M6 and silicone ends make me think it will do better keeping the sand out. The front of the MaxSound Plus has holes and if the speaker is knocked in the sand I fear it may get sand on the drivers. The M6 was almost half the price. The M6 feels like you could throw it and withstand damage better, pure speculation.\n\nIf the Tribit MaxSound Plus speaker was lighter it would be my new beach speaker. I am keeping the M6 as I already have to carry a beach tent, towels, sand castle toys, & a toddler. The weight played the major deciding factor for me. Anker could have been a top contender but dropped the ball on the outdated charger port and no cover.\n\nAnker does have an upgraded version the SoundCore 2, WITH a charger and aux port cover, however still micro USB charger, also mentions a bass up feature however it's currently $40 without a coupon. If it was USB-C I'd give it a chance.\n\nAnker Soundcore is the cheapest option of the 4 and the Anker Soundcore does sound better than the Eduplink M6 from the front. The Anker gets louder and has better clarity than the Eduplink. I fear the micro-usb charger failing especially having it on the beach sitting in the sand. I will keep the Eduplink M6, because the USB-C charger plus being a covered port so sand won't play a factor.",

I highly recommend it for listening to music (or whatever else you listen to) as you move around the house. It's small, light, and therefore easily transportable as you move from one room to another. Haven't yet used it outside but can only imagine it will do the trick wherever I go.\nHighly recommended.",
