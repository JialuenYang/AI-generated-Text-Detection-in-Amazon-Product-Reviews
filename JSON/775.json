They are not 100% noise canceling but it's enough I can't hear much. The price tag for such good sound can't be beat. They charge well and the case is very small. A tiny improvement would be if the case had a small bar so they can be attached to keyrings or hooked in a bag. For now they easily slip into a pocket or purse.",

			"body": "The TOZO A1 Minis are a solid low profile pair of TWS earbuds. They just get the job done. Nothing particularly wrong with them nor spectacular which is fine. If I were to give a rating based on the price I got them at (about 15$ before sales tax) I'd give them 5 stars, but that may not be the case when you the consumer are browsing low budget options for wireless earbuds so I'm critiquing them at their roughly 30$ retail price.\n\nThe sound quality is solid for the price. The mids are good enough, the bass feels a bit recessed, and the treble can sometimes seem sibilant depending on the song. These issues are further exacerbated the louder you crank up the volume. It's not that bad because there’s way worse sounding TWS buds in this price range, but it's just something worth mentioning. The other thing I'm a bit mixed on is the battery life, but it's another small compromise you have to deal with in this price bracket. It's good enough sort of like how I described the sound quality but I wish the actual listening time was in that 8 hour range alongside the case with maybe an addition 10 hours charge time. But these are a small low profile pair, and the case as well is tiny so it is what it is. 5.3 Bluetooth connectivity is nice though I'll say, have not had connection issues and you can sort of walk around your house with your phone down and not have the audio cut-out.\n\nOverall I may came off as a bit negative/dismissive, but I just wanted to give a realistic assessment. Like I said for about 15 bucks if you're able to get it for that price it's nearly a no brainer if your pockets are a bit tight right now. The compromises I mentioned earlier would be mostly negated at that shoestring budget price. Otherwise I'd spend another 15-25 dollars and go up a tier like with the Soundpeats Engine 4.",

			"title": "Better than TOZO's higher offerings",
			"body": "Okay I have had these for about a week and am ready to review them after running them every day with a lot of music of various genres.\nIn this review I am comparing them to the TOZO T12, which are supposed to be TOZO's better pair.\n\nThe sound of the A1 isn't amazing, but it is clear enough and represents the entire range in a very nice and clean way from mids to highs, although the highs may be slightly cut off. The staging is somewhat poor but that is sort of to be expected, it is a true left/right experience with little depth yet good sound. Battery life so far has been okay enough for me, although I wish they lasted 10 hours so they could be used through a full shift.\nCompared against the T12, the T12 wins in the sound department. The bass is punchier, there is more separation in instruments, and the overall sound is wider and more 'open,' although overall the t12 is still quite closed. The t12 clearly sound slightly better.\nYet between the two I would choose the A1's over Tozo's other offerings. Why? The bliss of silence. The T12 hiss quite bad in the ears, making them very bad for audiobooks. Now these A1 minis? Not only are they vastly more comfortable due to their size, they are COMPLETELY SILENT when not playing music, and when voices are talking there is NO HISSING or white noise. That is what makes these actually quite amazing for the price, and it's really sad that TOZO's more expensive earbuds all hiss in your ears. Go with these, and if you need more battery life just get two pairs in different colors (so you don't mix them).\nThese earbuds are great.",

			"body": "I don't understand! I bought a newer version of these ear buds just a couple days ago, yet when I came to review them it brought me into my old review of over a year ago? What's up with that Amazon? Anyway, as you can see below this paragraph is my year-ish ago review. These newer ear buds are far better then the older ones. They have great sound, easy to pair with all my devices (including my gaming PC), and the touch/tap commands are easy to follow - they don't always work, but they're easy to follow. For example, it comes with them set in a \"bell/beep\" type setting for indicating things like connecting, power low warning, etc. The instructions say to tap three times to get it to set to voice prompts (which I prefer, as the first time they ran down on power it was apparently sending me odd beep sounds. I paid the beeps no attention because I thought the beeps were coming from my game. I only figured it out after the buds shut off). So I tapped three times on the right bud - nothing, I tapped three times on the left - still nothing. I tapped 3 times again on the right and heard a beep. Since the instructions don't appear to say what the beeps mean, I have no idea if I was successful. Including even a brief mention of what the beeps mean would get nearly a five star review from me. As it is, I'll just have to wait and see if voice prompts are even possible with these. Just a suggestion, since the previous two types of these ear buds came with voice prompts already set, you might consider making these newer ones also come with voice prompts already set so you don't unnecessarily confuse and thus annoy your repeat customers. Over all, for the price (was on sale for around $15 U.S.) these are pretty good little buds - not the best for sure, but well worth even the normal $30ish they ask at the time of this review.\n\nOLD UPDATE: I finally found the brand I had been looking for and bought a second set. The quality is great and the battery life is about eight hours. Even so, this isn't about those ear buds, it's about these TOZO buds. Not long after I left my original review the company reached out to me and presented an offer to make up for my opinion of their ear buds. (My previous review below included only three stars, I would like to note that I know how this update might look considering what follows, but I assure you I am not bought, I speak my real mind in truth. That's just how I was raised. In any case, just read on and decide for yourselves.) They really like their product and wanted a second Chance to get a better opinion from me. Perhaps the pair of ear buds I originally got from them were just a bad set, I don't know. Anyway, they offered to replace the set I bought for free, also they offered a different set for free if I didn't want to try the first set again. I thanked them for the offer, but I found the original brand I'd been looking for (as noted below/above) and didn't need any more ear buds. However, about a week later they again reached out with the same offer adding that they really just wanted to make things right because they work hard to make sure all their customers are satisfied with their products. In truth, it seems their customer care services are very motivated, they do go out of their way to satisfy their customers. By my wife's suggestion I took them up on their offer for a different pair, the TOZO model T9. Instead of being small and hiding in the ear, these have a tail that resembles some Apple brand buds. Once I received them I charged them up and tried them out. They were much better than the first ones I bought, sound quality was very clear, I could even understand the voice in the buds telling me when they were connected. Most impressive though was the length of time the batteries appeared to last, I started using them about 12:30 p.m., and they finally ran out of juice at around 10:30 p.m. That was with non stop use! So I would like to add two things here. First, this company really prides itself on taking care of their customers. Second, I am especially glad my wife talked me into taking them up on their offer, because these second set of ear buds really met the great reviews that convinced me to try these in the first place.\n\n(Previous review:)\nI had bought a different pair for about the same price as these and was so impressed that I decided to buy a second pair. Since I couldn't find the ones I was looking for I decided to try these based on so many positive reviews. After receiving these, charged them up, set them up, used them for roughly four hours and the right ear bud ran out of power fallowed shortly by the left one. The other brand I used might have spoiled me a bit since they easily last a full eight hours before needing recharged. These also do not have the sound quality as my other pair even though they both were under $20. Finally, the announcer on this pair that tells you when you've hooked up to a Bluetooth connection, or when the ear buds need recharged is really hard for me to understand. Sorry but the accent is simply too distorted to make out clearly. I'll use these as an backup set for now, but I'm really going to look harder to find the brand I originally purchased since, for about the same price, they are far superior in every way.\n\nYour milage may be better than mine, but I won't be buying these again.",

			"body": "UPDATE: My original review complained about the controls, which I found difficult to use initially. After several days, I've gotten better at tapping and holding, and am having greater success in controlling the output. In addition, I switched from Podcast Player to Pocket Casts (on a Samsung phone), and now I'm able to double-tap to go forwards and backwards in the same episode, which is what I really wanted. (I care much less about moving to the next/prior episode). My only remaining complaint is that whatever I was last playing still starts automatically the second I remove the earbuds from their case. I now just single tap one of them to pause the playback, and then try to screw them into my ears without accidentally starting them up again (and that's hard).\nHowever, I feel that for $16, this is now definitely worth 5 stars.\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nLet me start by saying that these are a good buy. For under $16, I wasn't expecting deluxe earbuds. The sound is fine for podcasts, which is what I listen to.\nWhat puzzles me is that everyone else is very happy with the controls, while I find them extremely difficult to use. I have them configured (via the Tozo app) so that one tap on either side should start or stop the podcast. Neither earbud reliably registers the tap every time. Double-tapping the right bud skips to the next episode, and that works OK most of the time. However, double-tapping the left bud, which should go to the previous episode, does not work at all (I've tried it from various places in my queue.). I had to disable triple-tapping on both sides--it's supposed to activate the Voice Assistant--because the buds didn't seem to distinguish between double- and triple-tapping. Long pressing the buds to change the volume is finicky as well. And there's no tapping option to skip ahead or go back in the same episode.\nAfter spending half an hour testing all the taps and experimenting with different configurations via the Tozo app to see if I could make the taps work better, I gave up, and decided just to use the phone's podcast app for all these functions.\nThe other thing that's weird is that when I take the buds out of their case, they immediately begin to play the podcast that I listened to most recently, EVEN if I exited the podcast and closed the podcast app (I use Podcast Player) on my phone. And EVEN though the podcast app is configured to not allow external devices to start playing. So by the time I get the earbuds out and screwed into my ears, I have to back up 30 seconds to catch what I just missed.\nSo those are my kvetches. Having said all that, they're a good buy for the money. (I'll update this review if they don't last long). And I really appreciate the slick storage/charging case, and the fact that they came with multiple sizes of earbud tips.",

			"title": "Disappointed but keeping them",
			"body": "First of all these are my second pair of Tozo ear buds. My last pair lasted many years until the battery gave out after heavy daily use. I was happy with them so I got a new pair from them. Let talk pros.\n\nTHESE ARE TINY! I was shocked, I knew they were smaller than my old ones but they are almost comical how small they are.\n\nBattery life is good. These last easily the advertised 6 hours and from dead the case can charge the buds about 3ish times. Pretty good\n\nUSB C at this price amazing. That's it that's the tweet.\n\nNow I'm sure you read the title so let'sntalk the cons and why I'm disappointed\n\nBattery life indicator. It does not want to disclose what it's remaining life is. It flashes quickly when putting a bud in and that's it you have to remove and replug the bud to check it. No other way to check\n\nSound quality. These are NOT good as far as base. They are thin and all mids. That said it's not terrible for me as I listen to podcasts so not a deal breaker.\n\nThe fit. My biggest disappointment. To be clear it's not the buds fault but they hurt my ears. I've tried wearing them several different ways with a few days break in between and several ear tips. They just plain hurt my ears. This is sad because I would tolerate the other cons if not for this.\n\nOverall these are great especially for the price. They are good build quality and they are good enough for most people. However I think if you are concerned about them hurting or like more than mids in your ear buds you may want to reconsider. If you need some earbuds you can toss around and won't be too sad if you lose or break them I say go for it. As for me I'm going to clean them and give them to someone as a gift.",

The sound quality is superb and comparable to some of the higher priced products out there. Another HUGE plus is the number of ear bud choices and the different shapes. I have smaller ears and smaller ear canals and love that I could choose not only a different sized bud but a different shape. I wind up listening for 10+ hours a day alternating ear pieces as I work outside on residential properties and need to hear while on property and my ears don't hurt. Its the most comfortable head set I've ever owned. I can not recommend these enough. Price low and the quality and value is amazing. Don't miss out on these.",

My ONLY day to sleep in, whatsoever, is Saturday. Given that the 5-year-old wakes up before the sun on school days, she isn’t any more patient on Saturdays and quite often wakes up everyone else in the house around 4:30/5am.

Whether it’s a school day, my Sunday responsibilities, or the kids coming in asking for a snack/a phone to play on (you have a million toys, PLAY WITH THEM!)/to get changed/or any other typical kid request, also god forbid the dog doesn’t get her medication on time or she has an accident because no one let her outside.

Also I should mention that these come with a lot of different tips to use, but I like to use the small ones. By the way, the charger they come with is a short USB-C type, so if you want to charge them at any distance at all, you'll need a different cord.

So I decided to give these a try until I could figure out what to do about perhaps buying another expensive pair in the future.\nBeing a huge fan of music, I like to consider myself an audiofile with a taste for very high quality sound for my music. Before I bought this set here on Amazon, I gave another site a try selling a (slightly) used pair of Bose quiet comfort first generation. The sound wasn't that great, and overrated my opinion. But I return them because I couldn't link the pods to my phone. I researched the problem and found other buyers had the same issue, I returned them in the in.\nAs far as cost, packaging, fit, pairing, operation, these TOZO earbuds are extremely difficult to beat in those regards and receive 10 out of 10 stars in my opinion. But sound quality, I wasn't expecting much and sadly I was right. With bass sounding nearly non-existent It's sound is similar to a 1960s transistor radio.

			"body": "Sound quality is great and controls are easy to use! The app is great too because you can change some settings like EQ there. The downside is that the silicone ear pieces it comes with are very small. The largest one is probably closest to a size medium. They provide 5 sizes to try but they are all smaller than the default ones that come already attached. They are continually falling out of my ears while working at my desk job. I have not even tried to do any kind of exercise with them in.\nYou can also tell from the pictures that there are clearly two different manufacturers of the silicone pieces they provide. The default ones are far right in the picture if that helps.",

			"title": "Good sound quality and comfortable",
			"body": "These headphones have great sound quality for the price. They also come with a few different sizes for the pieces that go in your ear, so it's easy to find a size that works for you. I have seen plenty of headphones that only come with 3 sizes, including the ones that are already on the headphones, but these ones came with 5. I always struggle finding headphones that stay in my ears without creating a pocket of pressure behind them. My ears are very sensitive, so most headphones hurt my ears, but these ones are great. I wouldn't say these are the best headphones I've ever had, but for the price, they are great.",

			"body": "I love these earbuds. I have bought multiple pairs (not because of the product not working, but because I accidently crushed one pair when lowering my car seat 🙃, although while the case no longer works for that pair, the earbuds themselves still stay strong as I charge them with my current case. You can use them individually or both at the same time with no problem. After a couple months, the magnet did start to have a problem and cane off when I opened the case. I put a small piece of tape to hold it in place and it works perfect. You can't any tell! (This is also probably because I am a little rough with them) I definitely regiment getting a pair. I also once lost one and just played a video really loud out of them and heard it from upstairs, I was very impressed.",

They charge fast, about 3 hours or so from dead to full.\nHowever they only hold a 3.5 hour playtime charge. Straight out of the box, first fully charge to empty, 1 earbud at a time. 3.5 hours. 1 year later. Still 3.5 hours playtime. That's lousy.\nOtherwise the sound is decent and the noise cancellation is decent. Not bad at all.\nExcept for the playtime. I have to swap them out several times during an 8 hour shift.",

			"body": "i did a lot of reading reviews on amazon before purchasing these and i have to agree with the majority: these are truly superior for such a low price. the app offers a lot of extra features. but they're also very simple.. one tap to play/stop, one tap to answer the phone. no problems at all with phone calls. they're small and fairly discreet.\n\nthe price point was a big factor in choosing these and the sound quality and noise cancellation are truly better than more expensive ones. i'd give them 6 stars for exceeding expectation. tozo seems to be a really good brand.\n\nlove being able to have both buds in and just get immersed in some good music. it's trippy if you have the right sort of lettuce to mix with it.",

Got about 5 hours of continuous use today (mostly music) before a recharge was needed. These are my 1st Bluetooth earbuds, so the only thing I can compare them to are the wired headphones and earbuds, many of which were \"studio monitor\" quality. These come very close and are a lot more comfortable to wear throughout the day. Will see how long they last!",

			"body": "Overall, I am very happy with these earbuds. I liked the following points:\n-They provide great sound quality.\n-Call come through crystal clear.\n-Holds a charge well.\n-Love that I have color choices.\n-The “insert and twist” to fit in the ear takes some getting used to, but was not very difficult. It gave me a feeling of security that they wouldn’t be falling out of my ears.\n-Pairing with my phone was a breeze.\n-I still use my phone to pick up calls rather than touching the earbuds, but that’s just my preference.\n\nMy only and biggest gripe is that I wish there was a way to adjust the bass down, as I listen to a lot of audio books and symphonic music, using more treble.\n\nAside from that, I have purchased a set for my friend, and plan to purchase a couple more sets for gifts.\n\nSuggestion:\nIt would be really nice if there was some sort of loop for a carabiner or key ring on the case. Or maybe link a compatible case cover? They are inexpensive enough to replace, but I would prefer not to misplace them if possible.",
