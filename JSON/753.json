			"title": "Great beginner set!",
			"body": "My twins were taking an interest in music, so I knew I had to get them an instrument for their 8th birthday. I looked at so many keyboards and had the hardest time choosing between this set and a Casio keyboard.\nHonestly, this just seemed like a cheap set, while the Casio has touch response keys, which make it more similar to a real piano. Although the Casio was more expensive, I almost got that, but in the end, I chose Rock Jam and am very satisfied.\nThis comes with everything you need! Keyboard, stand, bench, headphones, and sustain pedal. I think the sound is great! It's so easy for my daughters to use and I got them a few piano books, so they're really enjoying it. They're true beginners, but have been playing every day, and in just a few days, they could play some simple Christmas songs. It's a wonderful hobby and so great for their little minds. My 3 year old loves to sit down and play too!\nDown the road, I might buy the Casio, but for now, this set is perfect for learning and it was affordable, so we're very happy with it. :)",

			"title": "Nice set up for kids",
			"body": "I got this for my 12 year old daughter. She isn’t trained but likes to play and her old keyboard finally broke after 5 years. This one is pretty nice. The stand and bench are both very sturdy although adults should be careful on the bench. The stands height adjustment is easily done. There are straps to secure the keyboard to the stand so it can’t be accidentally knocked off although the low overall weight of the entire assembly feels like it might get pushed over so we opted to place it against the wall. The music holder is not attached so that might be an issue if it comes off it could get broken. I actually didn’t realize it came with headphones so that was a wonderful surprise-she can play and we can still watch tv since it’s in the living room. There’s a plug for a microphone too. Assembly took maybe 10 minutes. Very pleased with it. Daughter loves it so that’s all that matters",

			"title": "Great Keyboard But Here Are Some Things To Consider",
			"body": "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 13-yr-old and have been very happy! I'd like to point out some things that I think might be helpful for those considering buying it:\n\n1) The picture on Amazon is a little misleading. At first glance, it looks as if there is a large display on the top of the keyboard showing the piano learning application/notes to be played. If you look closer, you'll realize it's a tablet sitting on the top of the keyboard, showing the app. The \"display\" feature mentioned in the product description is a small display directly above the keyboard. Obviously, the piano doesn't come with a tablet included. I knew this when I purchased the keyboard but I think it's worth pointing out. My kid has used his iphone propped on top of the keyboard to play the application so he can learn piano. It works okay. The notes can be a little hard to see at times, but it's not that bad. If you use your tablet to run a piano lesson application, it would be a lot easier probably but using the phone is still doable.\n\n2) This set comes with earphones. This is great! However, be aware that the \"Simply Piano\" application requires NO headphones because it has to \"listen\" to the piano being played to advance to the next level or lesson. I don't know if all of the piano apps require this but I didn't think about it when I purchased the keyboard. My kid can use the headphones when he's goofing around on the keyboard, but whenever he wants to use the app to learn, he has to use it without headphones. (I hear him play and practice, which is both a fun upside and a noisy downside. lol)\n\n3) There are A LOT of buttons so the keyboard looks very complicated. I think this keyboard is a great buy for beginners interested in learning piano. My kid has really enjoyed it. There are a lot of features & functions. It's a little intimidating at first glance, but most of it is pretty intuitive. There are record & play back functions to play back what you've been playing, which my kid really likes. The are buttons to change the sound/instrument or rhythm. I didn't see any point in overwhelming my kid by going through every description of every button in the manual, but he's had fun exploring & figuring out what each button does on his own.\n\n4) What I love most about this keyboard is how much fun he has been having with music. The \"Simply Piano\" application has been good and the keyboard itself has been exactly what I wanted. In my opinion it's a very good value at this price if you're interested in learning to play the piano/keyboard.",

			"title": "Comes with a damper/sustain pedal but no microphone",
			"body": "My piano kit arrived sooner than expected. I’m happy with the performance and appearance. The sound quality is good enough for me—an improvement compared to my old Lowrey keyboard from 20+ years ago. The keys of this keyboard feel more like a real piano’s compared to my old Lowrey. I chose this Rockjam piano because it came with a damper/sustain pedal (I didn’t need the microphone that most other electric pianos come with), and I liked that the stand has built-in holes for thumb screws (included) to screw the stand into the piano. Unfortunately, the stand was disappointingly wobbly and not sturdy. It looks like other electric piano keyboards being sold on Amazon have a similar flimsy stand. I screwed the Rockjam piano into my old (heavier, sturdier) Lowrey stand, and that works for me.\n\nDimension info:\nThe sheet music holder is 16.75 inches long. That’s longer than most on the market, but I wish it was even longer.\nThe stand to hold up the piano is 32.5 inches long. It is of adjustable height ranging from 20.5 to 31.5 inches. It is less than 5 pounds.",

I put it on the stand in the basement. It's got two keys that no longer stick. The batteries, I don't think I ever needed to replace them. I have no idea where the cord wandered off to...?\n\nThis is a great kids music tool for beginners and just in general for child creative content. I love that it can be set up and they choose whether to play with it or not. My one kid has learned some presets by ear by now and enjoys playing by ear though he has also learned to read music by now. We are using the Accent on Achievement series.\n\nI might replace it with the same device if the keys get any worse, I think they probably were rougher on it as younger kiddos. It's a good learning device and a childhood of entertainment if your kids are careful enough.\n\nWe also bought or made little piano key stickers. Buy it, and break a leg, not the bank!",

My wife suggested I buy a keyboard for my office and learn to play again, and I agreed. I looked at a lot of reviews and decided on this purchase because it came with a stand, stool, and headphones. It also included stickers for the keys for beginners. The sound is close to piano, but not quite, which annoys me. The range is not good at all, and after some playing, I decided to stay on the lower end of the piano because if you go above middle C, the notes become very shrill. I play along to songs I like, and the tone does not match perfectly. For learning, it has been great, but I am now looking to upgrade to a better-sounding keyboard. If the volume is too loud, I have noticed that the speakers have a rattle in them. I don't play very loud often, but when I want to show off to my wife, it is a little embarrassing. Overall, I'm happy with the product and would purchase it again if I was in the same mindset.",

No. Should you expect it to? Also no. I purchased it for my spouse for the holiday and they enjoy it. The free 30 days of the app/course is a nice addition. The fact that it has headphones is nice, but you may struggle to learn from your phone/ipad/tablet *and* hear the piano through the headphones, so just keep that in mind. You need to be able to hear the notes and lessons on the app, which is a bit challenging with the headphones on and connected to the piano.\nMy major issue is how wobbly the stand is. This isn't user assembly error and it isn't wobbly floors. It wiggles quite a bit, to the point that it is distracting while trying to play. The keyboard does kind of \"mount\" to the stand (it's two straps and two screws that go into the bottom of the keyboard, but there's probably about 4\" of movement available), but the wobble is concerning.\nI contacted both Amazon customer service and the RockJam customer service (Per Amazon's instructions), so TBD if there is resolution to the wobbly stand.",

			"title": "Embarrassing",
			"body": "I do not understand all of the positive reviews. If I were still in the return window and if my husband hadn't thrown away the packaging, I would definitely return this because it is the worst-sounding keyboard I have ever heard. My toddler has Baby Einstein toys that sound better than this.\n\nI am a voice teacher and I needed to purchase a decent keyboard so that I could teach over Zoom while I was traveling to my parents out of state. With all of the positive reviews and for a $110 investment, I figured this wouldn't be as good as what I'm used to but it would do the job of allowing me to continue teaching smooth lessons—I'm not a great pianist to begin with, so literally all I need it to do is play block chords and not sound ridiculous. First of all, the default volume setting is the loudest setting. This means that if you have a toddler running around turning the keyboard on and off, no matter how low you set the volume, it's always going to be ridiculously loud when it turns back on. It also means that when the keyboard keeps on periodically turning off while you are teaching (?!) you have to adjust the volume again.\n\nSecondly, there is a huge variety of sounds available, but unfortunately none of them actually sound ANYTHING like a piano. The setting that they designate as piano is just atrocious. I have used different sounds like marimba while teaching my voice lessons because it's a little less jarring and it makes my young students laugh. I work with some professional-level students and I feel self conscious telling them that I have to use marimba or another sound so their ears don't bleed.\n\nThe other big problem is that when I play a chord on this keyboard, sometimes the sound cuts out and turns back on again very loudly! It's jarring and embarrassing for me when this happens. I feel very unprofessional and flustered when I teach on this keyboard. I could have just used my kid's toy piano from Melissa and Doug and I would have felt more confident.",

			"body": "Listen. I liked the price. That's why I bought this. I decided that \"hey i'm not a master piano player and i just want to learn so something not so expensive won't hurt me.\" however if you speak to anyone and i do mean ANYONE who is at any skill level over an absolute beginner in piano they will tell you that there are several things that are needed to to learn piano correctly. You may say, as i did, \"that sounds like gatekeeping bullhonkey and they just want you to spend a ton of money on a not-necessary keyboard.\" However through my own experience. Talking to experienced piano players and through testing of my own on various types of pianos that i could touch for free i learned that it was not bullhonkey.\n\nLet me start with the most important feature of a keyboard meant to be learned how to play an actual piano on. It needs to have all the keys a regular piano would have. That means 88 keys. You'll notice this product does not have that.\n\nSecond is that it has what's called \"dynamic sound.\" i was confused by this term but it basically means if you play a key hard the sound is louder. If you play it soft the sound is quieter. This keyboard does not have that.\n\nThird is weighted keys. \"oh god why would i need weighted keys that sounds like a way to hike up the price for no reason.\" let me assure you i tested this out. the best explanation i got out of piano teachers was \"it doesn't feel like a real piano.\" and i am not one to just blindly follow what somebody else tells me so before i returned this item i went around my community and found several different types of keyboards and actual pianos ranging from this keyboard to a semi-weighted keyboard, a fully weighted keyboard and actual baby grand piano's and upright pianos. Weighted keys matter because if the keys don't resist you comparatively similarly to a real keyboard you will ingrain bad habits that are a NIGHTMARE to unlearn.\n\nyou might be sitting here saying \"this is all i can afford what am i supposed to do.\" Listen i get it. Pandemic hit us all hard financially. my advice? go to the used market. find an 88 key weighted keyboard used. I ended up finding an old OLD model of weighted key keyboard with a key not working and the piano expert i talked to said it would STILL be better than this thing. I paid 150 for that. Think about that. I got an expert approved keyboard that was from 1989 that was supposed to work better for learning piano than this thing.\n\nNow listen. If you are just getting this thing for your kids to bang away on or for the fun electronic recording features and/or you just want to learn to play a specific, easy song on the piano then i'd say feel free to buy this one. If you want to seriously learn piano by being self-taught (which is totally valid) or you have a kid who is earnest in wanting to play piano then don't buy this keyboard the damage it will do to their learning is NOT worth the admittedly awesome price.",

			"title": "Disappointed: Okay keyboard for kids, DO NOT RECOMMEND for experienced players",
			"body": "I would not recommend this keyboard to any prospective buyer. I haven’t made a review before but felt compelled to do so for this product. It is not worth the money. It is a small keyboard with only 32 keys, although it is advertised as 61. You can get a far better keyboard on Amazon with just a little extra cost. This keyboard should be advertised towards kids starting their piano learning. The height of the chair and the numbers of keys is limited just for beginners. It only comes with 5 octaves. The Bass is uncomfortably loud, to the point that it becomes unbalanced and masks the Soprano. You can barely hear the melody, when playing with your right hand as the higher notes get swamped in the lows. Although the keyboard is electronic and not hammered, the keys are very slippery under your fingers and not close to the acoustic sound of a piano in comparison to the other keyboards of similar price ranges. The volume adjustment varies a lot by just one level change, yet the quietest volume on the keyboard can still be very loud.",

I purchased this for my 5 yr old, (although it can be used for an adult as well), and the adjustable stand brought the keyboard down to just the right height for her. (it goes pretty low to normal height)\nSEAT: is not adjustable, but since the stand is, so it doesn't matter. The seat is a bit small. It's probably fine for a very small adult and children. But if you are an average to larger size person like me, then you will want to purchase the piano separately and get a larger keyboard/piano bench.\nHEADPHONES: not a very good quality. They crackle at times. I use a child's headphone set because it limits the volume output.\nLCD SCREEN: Is nice. If you want to know what a key is, you just press the key and it shows up on the grand staff on the screen. But I use sticker notes for my daughter, and you can see them better. Nice to have a built in metronome.\nCON: (-1 star) Every time you turn the keyboard on, the default volume is max, and you have to adjust it. I don't see a place where I can change this to default to a lower setting. My casio turns down extremely low, and when I turn it off, the next time I use it, it is still at the volume I left it on. I wish that is how this one was.\nKEYS: I find these keys are stiffer than my Casio keys. I was worried about my 5yr old being able to use them, but she seems to do fine with them, so they must not be that stiff.\nOVERALL: great set & great price for a beginner.",
