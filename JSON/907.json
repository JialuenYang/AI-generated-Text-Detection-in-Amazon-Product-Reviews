			"body": "I’m happy to share my experience with the LEVN Bluetooth 5.0 Headset. I’ve been using it for a while now and I must say that it’s one of the best headsets I’ve ever used. The headset’s AI noise-cancelling technology is impressive and ensures that I can hear and be heard clearly, even in noisy environments. I work remotely so it is important that when I am on a conference call that the background noise be muffled. In addition to using the headset for work I use it in my personal time making calls to friends and family. The convenience of not having to hold a phone to my ear or close to my mouth to speak is invaluable. The headset’s 35-hour battery life is amazing and means that I can use the headset for several days without having to recharge it. If I ever do forget to recharge it and I need to use it, my husband bought a separate USBC cable from Amazon so I could charge it while I am on the phone. The headset is Bluetooth, so I have paired it to every device I have making it a versatile option for me. I paired it to my desktop computer, laptop, iPhone and even my Kindle Fire. It was easy and took very little time.\nI, also, use the headset to listen to podcasts and audiobooks while working out. The headset’s comfortable earmuff and 270° rotatable microphone make it easy to use the headset for extended periods without experiencing discomfort. I tried both the left side and the right to find the one that was just right for me. The fact that I can use one ear to listen to my surroundings while wearing the headset is a great feature that ensures I remain aware of my surroundings while listening to my favorite artists and authors.\nOverall, I would highly recommend the LEVN Bluetooth 5.0 Headset to anyone who needs a reliable and versatile headset for work, online classes, or for personal enjoyment.",

			"body": "I recently acquired the LEVN Bluetooth 5.0 Headset, and I must say that it has exceeded all my expectations. This headset is a true game-changer in the world of wireless audio devices, earning every bit of its 5-star rating.\n\nFirst and foremost, the sound quality is absolutely outstanding. With the advanced Bluetooth 5.0 technology, it offers a seamless and crystal-clear audio experience. The bass is deep, the mids are crisp, and the highs are detailed. Whether I'm listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the audio quality is consistently top-notch.\n\nThe AI Noise Cancelling feature is a real showstopper. It effectively blocks out background noise, making phone calls and video conferences a breeze, even in noisy environments. The built-in microphone is incredibly sensitive, ensuring that my voice comes through clearly while ambient sounds are virtually non-existent to the other party.\n\nOne of the standout features of the LEVN Bluetooth Headset is the extraordinary battery life. With an impressive 35 hours of playback time on a single charge, I rarely find myself reaching for the charger. This longevity is perfect for long trips, workdays, or simply not having to worry about constantly recharging your headset.\n\nComfort-wise, the LEVN headset is a winner. It's lightweight, and the ergonomic design ensures that it fits snugly and securely on your head without causing discomfort during extended use. The ear cups are cushioned for extra comfort, making it a joy to wear for hours on end.\n\nThe build quality is robust, and the materials used feel premium. I appreciate the attention to detail that LEVN has put into this product, from the sleek design to the intuitive button layout and controls.\n\nThe Bluetooth pairing process is incredibly simple and quick, and it maintains a stable connection over a considerable distance. I've had no issues with disconnections or interference while using the headset.\n\nIn summary, the LEVN Bluetooth 5.0 Headset is a fantastic product that delivers on every front. It combines superb sound quality, excellent noise-cancelling capabilities, remarkable battery life, and superior comfort. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a professional needing clear communication, or simply seeking a reliable wireless headset, this product is an excellent choice. I highly recommend the LEVN Bluetooth 5.0 Headset to anyone in need of a high-quality audio companion. It has truly set the standard for wireless headsets, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. Five stars well-deserved!",

I was weary about all its perks because not everything you read about a product is true.\n\nWhen I received the headset the packaging was simple and it came with a charging stand. The headset itself is sleek and clean looking. I charged it to full capacity and it paired effortlessly to my work computer. It has the volume button on the side of the headset a long with a mute button. This is very convenient. Wearing it is a lot more comfortable than I am used to. So it works great for long working hours. The background noise it picks up is very minor. I have 3 rowdy children! So I know It keeps the noise drowned out. I do wish the charging stand wasn’t so sensitive and it had features for answering the phone for my job using the headset, but that’s really all I can say would be a con.\nI would 100% recommend this product to anyone who works from home!",

I have four 3D printers in my office that run most of the time I am in it, so I needed something that would allow me to be on a call without interrupting my conversation with too much noise. I have been using it for over a month without issue.\n\nThe noise-canceling function is a game changer. I have been on both ends of this headset, and as a caller, you cannot hear the 3D printer noise at all. The volume gets loud enough to fill all the needs I have. I have used it for TEAMS calls, conference calls over IP, and zoom meetings, and I can say this headset is fantastic. The battery life is excellent. I have not had to stop in the middle of the day to charge the headset. I have yet to test exactly how long it will go, but it fills my day without issue.\n\nThe ear cushion is soft and has yet to leave me wanting something thicker. Build quality is on par with something more expensive. Nicely made.\n\nAs someone who used to use a Plantronics headset, I can tell you that for the money, this headset is FANTASTIC!!",

Although I did experience the issue mentioned below in my original review, the company reached out several times and really went above and beyond to stand behind their products and ensure that they could turn this into a positive experience without me even pushing the issue. Exceptional customer service is such a rare quality nowadays, so I felt compelled to make sure I made this update to give the company credit for their actions.\n\nI really wanted to love this headset. I tried it for about 30 days and had to return it. I can say it’s super easy to setup and the speaker and microphone were crystal clear with no static or extra noise, even if you blow on the microphone (which is a habit I have to check if my mic is working, so fortunately or unfortunately, that test doesn’t work with this microphone). My issue with the headset is that the charging prongs on the standing charger don’t automatically engage with the charging port on the headset when you store the headset on the stand. I had to wiggle the headset back and forth on the stand to get it to connect with the charging prongs (you will know it’s charging because the indicator light changes color). Several times I’ve wiggled it into the right position to charge and closed down my home office for the day, only to pick up the headset for a conference call the following day and be met with a message stating “low battery”, at which point the headset shuts itself off. Super inconvenient and caused me to fumble around for my wired headset while unable to hear coworkers on the call actively speaking to me. After a few instances of this, I decided to return it. I know the headset can be attached directly to the charging cord, but I paid extra for the charging stand to have somewhere to both store it properly AND simultaneously charge it. Otherwise I would have just bought the cheaper version with no charging stand (which I still might do, because overall the headset worked great when it was charged).",

However, recently I have noticed an issue where the headset will not charge when turned on and docked. Sometimes the light does turn red, sometimes not, but eventually I will hear a voice saying \"Low battery, please charge\" even though it is right there, on the dock. My fix has been to turn off the headset and then dock it, where it seemingly charges with no issue. But you can imagine my frustration when I go to pick it up just before getting on a call, and the battery is low. This is a recent problem so YMMV.",

The dock is secure and a great place to sit head set while not in use.\n\nFavorite features : mute button gives a “mute on/mute off” whisper instead of a light at the microphone.\n\nMicrophone has a pop guard soft cover.\n\nMic boom is very flexible and can be set in any position. Left and right ear options.\n\nEar cushion is nice and comfy. On hear, not over ear.\n\nHead set is very light and stays in place well. Great for all day wear.\n\nOver all the value is great, and I highly recommend. A perfect upgrade from my JLab that I had for a year, which was working fine until I adjusted the mic so much that I am sure I broke the wire inside. It was also heavy and two eared, so I was looking for a lighter and single ear upgrade. Only thing left to test is longevity!",

I also get complaints about it cutting in n out at times BUT not as much as the first one.\n\nYou get what you pay for. Good thing I have a back up one that I’m able to use while this one charges for a day and a half before I can use it for 8 hours. Also when I’m on my 1 hour break I do put it back on the charger….. so it’s not like I’m draining the battery. Would I buy again, no but if this is in your budget and you have a back up it’s comfortable enough to wear for 8 hours so that’s something",
