I opted for a couple sizes larger than what I usually wear, aiming for that comfortable, loose fit that's perfect for lounging around the house. It hit the mark, offering comfort without looking oversized. While it's clear that the hoodie isn't made from luxury material, it definitely surpasses expectations for its price range. An unexpected win for me was the sleeve length; even in larger sizes, it can be a challenge to find sleeves that are long enough due to my height and arm length, but this hoodie managed it with ease. It's a solid choice for anyone looking for casual, comfortable wear with the bonus of well-fitting long sleeves.",
