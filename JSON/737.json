      "body": "All right. I figure it's about time to write up a review of these headphones, seeing as I've spent some decent time with them and the Christmas sales should be happening and some of you may be wondering if you should spring for these - OR - wait it out until the next model Mk IV eventually shows up.\n\nThe most frequent question I get is \"How long do these last with Noise Cancellation on?\"\n\nWith the ANC (active noise cancellation) function ON - I've seen about 22-24 hours or so of Bluetooth-connected operation with these. The noise cancellation operation / ambient sound mode of these headphones are run entirely by the internal charged battery.\nSomeone asked me a while back if with the headphones connected to your phone via the headphone cable, if they would still have noise cancellation / ambient sound mode even if the battery was dead and the answer is no, no they will not. You can still listen to music through the 3.5 mm physical cable with a depleted battery, but noise cancellation will not be available. Actually, you also can't use Bluetooth / noise cancellation when even in the process of charging these headphones… (see \"gripes\" towards end of review).. so I guess it's good Sony decided to bestow a quick-charge 5-hour use time after a 10-minute charge function into these (using a wall receptacle USB adapter of course).\n\nBasically how it works is if you have an energized battery in the headphones you can use the noise cancellation and the Bluetooth connection - which also serves to activate the right ear cup touch-pad to perform functions on the headset.\nIf you have an energized battery and decide to use the direct 3.5mm headphone cable to connect to your phone or computer instead, you can still use the noise cancellation, but the touch-pad will not be available to utilize as the cord now takes over for Bluetooth to serve music (and as it depends upon the Bluetooth connection to \"talk\" to the paired device for functions, the touch-pad is disabled).\nIf you have a depleted battery you cannot use noise cancellation or the touch-pad but you can still get sound out of them like a regular pair of headphones by using the 3.5mm cable plugged into your phone or computer.\n\nThe connectivity through Bluetooth seems really robust. I have had only one minor issue since owning these where the sound of what I was listening to hiccupped out for a fraction of a second a couple times, but I think it had more to do with my phone not behaving at that moment and not the headphones themselves causing the problem. Walking around inside or outside or for traveling, the connection has remained stable since.\n\nHow \"Good\" the active noise cancellation works in any pair of headphones is somewhat subjective... but I can say these work really well, bearing a few things in mind and that we've not quite reached the technological level yet of producing truly silent headphones the quiets absolutely everything. Not for $350 dollars anyway.\n\nThe headphone Manual itself states that \"Noise Cancellation\" works primarily in the low frequency band and that although noise is reduced, it is not completely cancelled.\n\nI can best equate the effect with just the active noise cancellation mode on and with nothing playing through them, to having a good set of hearing protection earplugs in your ears.\nEverything sounds reduced, especially things like dronning, humming, knocking and footsteps...there is a general quieter sound you experience, but you're not left completely oblivious to some noise coming through a little.\nThese headphones will not surround you in a magical protective vacuum bubble when you have them on.\nHowever:\nThe real magic happens when you start playing music through these headphones or listening to a movie or such. With the active noise cancellation diminishing the outside sound pretty well all on its own, the sonic enjoyment of what is playing through the headphones is not restricted at all... you get full volume, clarity and bass and that simply causes the outside world to melt away, leaving you with a little comfort-cocoon that really does impress.\n\nI have had very good success with these headphones canceling out unwanted noises and / or being able to enjoy what I want to listen to across a range of scenarios: Noisy Neighbors next door doing noisy things, kids pounding around upstairs in the house, traveling in the car (as a passenger of course - not driving!), a couple bus commutes, and so forth.\n\nAs for the sound quality, I will say that they are very good. These are not high-end audiophile reference headphones costing thousands of dollars, but there is definitely high-quality audio out of these with a nice sound stage and separation with additional tweeking you can do through Sony's Headphone Connect application to adjust equalization and bass.\nThese are not the loudest headphones I've ever used... I've had models that are almost obnoxious in their power delivery, to the point of being painful to listen to with the volume all the way up. I am the type of listener who likes a bit of punchiness in their music, but also appreciates nuances over ham-fisted bass slamming into my ear canals at the expense of everything else...and I will say that with the noise cancellation feature turned on, I'm actually enjoying music at a lower volume level than I'd need with other headphones. The WH-1000XM3's ability to effectively mute the outside distractions allows me to concentrate on what I'm listening to, and I don't need the volume cranked up to enjoy a range of music.\n\nI did have to tweek a few things with the app to suit my preferences, but I am left very happy with what these can deliver. Of note, you can set two \"Custom\" EQ settings in the app, so one you might use for punchier bass and the other for higher treble or vocal listening.\n\nThe weight of these is impressively light. I might have been initially expecting them to have a weightier feel... maybe because I was thinking that with the added components necessary for noise cancellation, those would increase the headphone weight by several ounces. I'm happy to report that these headphones are able to be worn comfortably for extended duration with no feeling of pinched ears or sore spots. The ear cups on the WH-1000XM3's are of a more oval design than circular as found on my older Sony MDR-XB950BT headphones, and this makes them very comfortable to wear even laying back on a pillow or car seat. The thick padded circular ear cups on other headphones tends to press up against the back of a pillow or seat, and causes some pressure and discomfort against the back of my ears if worn too long when reclined.\nNo such issues with these.\n\nI have seen a few complaints online about people reporting that their ears get warm after wearing these for a while. Having spent some time with these, I personally think it's the effect of just wearing a pair of closed-back headphones with snug-fitting padded ear cups causing this. Every pair of closed-back headphones I've worn with padding that encapsulate your ears will get to feeling a little warm after extended sessions with them on. For me personally, I have not had discomfort with these on even after a few hours of listening to music and watching a movie with the noise cancellation activated.\n\nThe Phone Call microphone is something that many people seem to have initially hated on these headphones - many comments about how \"it's garbage\" and so on, reside on the internet.\nI am not sure where the hate is coming from, as I've had no issues making or taking phone calls with these, and nobody has complained about the call / microphone quality. Maybe Sony updated something in later production runs, but for whatever reason, the microphone seems fine on my pair. Certainly no worse than other headphones I've used. I will note that I did update the firmware to version 4.2.2 when I first fired-up the Sony App and when I used the headphones for the first time, so possibly that update may have corrected previous microphone problems.\n\nI have tested charging the WH-1000XM3's using an Anker PowerCore II 20000 battery bank and with a longer Anker USB-C to USB-A type cable than what Sony provides (see quibbles below), and they work together fine. The Anker battery bank will certainly output a 1.5 A current or more easily, which is what these headphones require for standard charging times.\n\nIn conclusion, I am very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones.\nSome people may consider these to be really expensive at $350 dollars US, but I don't think thats necessarily true. They're about $100 dollars more than other good quality headphones with similar performance sans active noise cancellation.\nIs the extra $100 bucks for having ANC worth it? To me, Yes. Definitely.\nThe noise cancellation ability of these has allowed me to enjoy quiet time and listening pleasure that otherwise I wouldn't be able to have with regular headphones.\nYou'll have to decide for yourself, but in a world with an ever increasingly loud and invasive noises you have to contend with daily, I've really really gotten to love using these, despite a few issues I don't really like.\n\n****************************************************\nSome minor quibbles:\n\nA literally 6-inch long USB-C to USB-A power cable, Sony?\nI just shelled out $350 bucks for a set of your headphones and you stuck me with a barely-useable power cable, never mind no included USB power adapter?\nYou couldn't get the bean counters to authorize even a foot of cable? Jeeze.\nIf you buy these headphones you are going to for sure want a longer USB-C to USB-A cable to charge these with. Anker has some nice ones you can get right here on Amazon.\n\nThe right-hand ear cup touch-pad is novel, and it has worked for me fine.\nMy only little grumble about it, is the function to pause the music or accept a phone call requires you to do a quick double-tap with your finger on the center of the ear cup touch-pad. Problem is, my ear is in there and the sound of my finger quickly tapping it makes a loud \"Thump-Thump!\" sound I find annoying. I would have MUCH preferred a physical button instead.\n\nI picked the \"silver / grey\" model color of these headphones, simply because they looked a bit different than the boring ol' black every other headphone comes in. I have noticed that depending on the color temperature of the surrounding light, they can appear to look anywhere from a silver / grey coloration to more of a champagne / very light tan in color. It's not off-putting, and I do like the color of the headphones... but some of you may not appreciate the reactive effect these have in either cool or warm colored light. Figured I'd mention it.\n\nMy big gripe: You cannot CHARGE these headphones and at the same time, listen with them using Bluetooth or with the ANC on. That seems backwards as Hell to me, considering I probably own at least 10 other electronic devices that CAN be used WHILE they are charging. My Smart Phone, yup. DSLR camera, sure. Voice Recorder, indeed. Graphing Calculator, Uh-huh. Sony MiniDisc Player from literally 15 YEARS ago? YES.\nSo why is it that with these modern $350 headphones, you can't plug them into a usb wall adapter, laptop, or battery bank with a USB-C cable and keep enjoying ANC and Bluetooth connection and listening enjoyment while charging? The moment you plug the USB-C charging cable into these, you lose all Bluetooth and ANC, and the sound shuts off until you stick the physical corded 3.5mm cable into the audio source…which at this point means you're now using a pair of regular headphones because again: No Bluetooth, no Active Noise Cancellation going on.\nVery very strange, and although with 20+ hours of listening on tap with a full charge, I still question if this isn't something that really should be improved upon with version Mark IV.\n\nWishes for FUTURE: Improved ANC with better elimination of higher pitched / sharp noises, maybe an available headphone stand that can provide the headphones with some type of inductive charging might be nice. Oh, and let us be able to charge AND listen to these with Bluetooth / ANC active at the same time please, Sony.",

      "title": "After 20 years of using Bose (and 2 Bose headsets at home), moved to Sony 1000XM3",
      "body": "I had Bose headsets for travel for over 20 years. I had Bose QC-1, QC-2; I still have QC-20 wired earbuds and aviation headset A20. Recently, I had a challenge of finding headset which not only works to cancel noise in an airplane, but which also works better than earplugs at home, especially to reduce noise of piano played in a different room. I compared Sony 1000XM3 with Bose QC35 and 700 at a store, bought two pairs of Sony, and compared them with Bose QC-20 and A20. On top of that, I did tons of research.\n\nTo begin with, Bose used to be \"the king of noise cancellation\" for many years. This reign is coming to an end: the competition is fierce. In pro aviation world, Lightspeed created a strong competition to Bose, while in the consumer world, Sony came up with a product widely superior in noise cancellation. Bose tried to answer Sony with Bose 700, but it is still inferior in noise cancellation and usability and features of the phone app.\n\nAccording to independent testing data available on the internet, Sony's noise cancellation is up to 6 dB better than Bose. If you are not familiar with dB scale, it is a log scale, and 6 dB is a little more than a factor of 2. Noise cancellation efficiency is frequency dependent, so it is hard to compare apples to apples. Power spectrum across all frequency gives an about 2 dB advantage to Sony (29 dB compared to 27 dB of Bose 700), in low frequency range Sony beats Bose with a high margin (about 6 dB), in high frequency range Bose appears to be better. Yet, when you put Sony on your head, followed by Bose, and switch back and forth, Sony is impressively better. Like, way better. Tons better. So much better that you sometimes wonder if Bose is turned on at all.\n\nComparing Sony XM3 with Bose QC20, Sony is better in all respects other than small size and weight of QC20. Noise cancellation is better, and sound quality is better. Comparison with aviation headset A20 shows that A20 is slightly superior in terms of noise cancellation (and, surprisingly, even in sound quality), probably due to a passive noise cancellation component - but A20 is a $1100 headset with a massive wire and console, and connectors are not compatible with consumer electronics. You would never consider it unless you fly an airplane as a pilot. High frequency hissing, which existed up to QC15 and still present in A20 (introduced in 2015) is almost gone in both newer Bose and in Sony. Difference in noise cancellation quality between Bose A20 and Sony XM3 is worth maybe $50, but not $800. I think we are talking about several dB, nothing major.\n\nSound quality is subjective. Neither Sony nor Bose 700 are audiophile grade. One cannot tell the difference while playing music via Bluetooth from a phone, but plug them with a cable into a headphone amplifier and play 24/96 music, compare with Hi-Fi headphones (I have good old Sennheiser HD-620 which used to be in the top 10 best some 20 years ago; not anymore, but they are still great sounding high end headphones) - and you can tell immediately that these are not Hi-Fi headphones. Not even close. With a good sound source, they sound dull and sound stage is not there. But they sound well enough for daily use, for playing music from the phone, certainly better than most earbuds. Sony sounds a little better than Bose 700 to my taste, but it is close, very close, there are small difference in color of the sound which are very subjective. I rated the sound five stars because this is not a Hi-Fi headset, it is a noise cancelling headset, and the price is determined primarily by its noise cancellation abilities. As long as you can listen to music and enjoy it, as long as it does not sound like cheap earbuds, it is OK. For really high quality of sound without noise cancellation, there are much better options in the same price range.\n\nApp is not required with Sony and Bose (despite misleading information on the web, either headset can be used without the app), but Sony app is much better. It does not require registration and has many more features, including adjustment of noise cancellation to ambient pressure.\n\nSony, to my surprise, works very well for phone calls in the office environment. There were many reports that Bose was vastly superior, perhaps this is the case when one needs aggressive noise cancellation, like on the street among cars and people. Or maybe Sony made updates to firmware which fixed the issues which they had. When answering calls at home, the sound quality on the other end of the line is excellent. People cannot tell I am wearing a headset.\n\nComfort is purely subjective and depends on one's head size and shape. I have a big head, so most headphones exert some pressure. Sony is no exception, but I am fine with that. I must say, the most comfortable headset for my head is Bose QC 35 II, followed by Sony XM3 and followed by Bose 700. Bose 700 feels a tad cooler on the ears. A20 creates too much pressure on my ears.\n\nFor travel (e.g., vacation) QC20 is hard to beat, due to their very small size. They are inferior to XM3 or latest Bose, but do their job well enough. For use at home or in the office, bluetooth headsets with better noise cancellation and better sound and with the ability to make calls are the way to go.\n\nFinally, cancellation of piano sounds. My wife teaches piano full time from home. Sound is a problem in our home. When I am in the same room as our grand piano, I can hear it loud and clear, although much less loud than without the headset. However, when I go to my office and close the door (which is a glass door which only partially blocks the sounds), I can barely hear it and can focus on whatever I am doing without distraction from the sounds. I tried QC20 for this purpose, and they were not quite up to the task. I got the 33 NRR rated 3M earplugs, and they also were not perfect either. I can tell that Sony XM3 works better. I would not use XM3 to work with power tools, though. They are too expensive and possibly too fragile for a workshop, and the benefit is not large enough to warrant the difference in price.\n\nBuild quality of Sony seems to be better than Bose (and less expensive, too). The headset is made in Malaysia. Bose, I must say, can make great quality headsets (A20, with 5 years warranty, is an evidence to that), but consumer grade headsets always had an almost marginal quality. Bose, by the way, does not repair them once they are out of warranty. They make you buy new ones with a discount. Two of my old Bose headphones broke and I had to replace them because repair option was not offered, and lifetime of synthetic leather ear pads was too short for a quality product. It is too early to say how well Sony would last - we will see.\n\nAfter buying the first headset on Amazon, I got another one for my son. My son absolutely wanted Bose, but after comparing them side by side in a store, and listening to mine, he said, I still like Bose, but I recognize that Sony is better in all respects... So we got him Sony from a local store.\n\nThe only frustrating part is that Amazon has dropped the price by $50 after I bought both pairs! What a bummer - but now, Bose is completely not competitive.\n\nThe only downside which I found so far... Sony can connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, but it is confusing how the preference works (the one connected last has the higher preference for audio), and there is no easy way to change the preference or even disconnect a specific sound source. You cannot do it in the app. I think Bose is the same way. I also struggled with connecting to my desktop PC for audio and gave up attempts to set up the audio preference correctly. Either I did not figure out how to do it correctly, or something can be improved in the next releases of the App and firmware. I am sure it will be done, eventually.\n\nFor what it is worth, competition between suppliers is good - it drives features and quality up and prices down. I hope, Bose will catch up eventually - they missed the opportunity to do it with the 700. Sony 1000XM3 remains the best product in this class for second year in a row.",

      "title": "Solid headphones, ignore misleading Amazon reviews",
      "body": "I was in the market for a pair of headphones, and looking at the Bose QCII and XM3s (which I honestly found from googling and seeing which reviewers recommended, I'm in no way an expert on headphones).\n\nMost reviews led me to believe the XM3s were the way to go, but I saw a ton of reviews on Amazon that called out really awful features/issues. Some commentary on things I was worried about:\n\n\"Headphones beep and turn off after 5 minutes of not using\" - This is a setting you can easily disable in the app. Like super easy. You should probably ignore any review where someone complains about that (lol), because it is honestly a very easy and quick setting to change, and is not hidden at all. I have not had any issues with my headphones beeping.\n\n\"The microphone is awful.\" - I don't use these often on calls, but I've been told my sound was good on the few calls I have used these on.\n\n\"Battery life is bad.\" - I haven't intentionally tried to run these down to a 0 battery to see how long they last, but I used these constantly in the first week I got them, and didn't charge them all week. My battery life has been fine.\n\n\"The touchpad is bad.\" It sounds like there are some legitimate concerns with using it in cold weather, but it's May so I haven't had a chance to test that. In general, the touchpad on the right here has been great. It took me a little getting used to on the first day, but since then I haven't accidentally paused it or changed tracks while trying to change the volume, or vice versa. The touchpad has worked great (but again, I've only tested it in warm conditions). I listen to a lot of audiobooks around the house so I pause a lot when my wife talks to me, and the doubletap to pause is very handy. The \"hold the ear\" feature to enhance the mic works well.\n\nGoogle assistant - haven't used it yet, will update if I do.\n\n\"These were very difficult to get to sync\". I've only linked these to my Pixel 2, but the process was quick and easy. I have not tr\n\n\"Sound quality is bad with X.\" Sound quality has been great music, audiobooks, and podcasts so far. I like to leave the headphones on the \"Bright\" EQ for everything I listen to. The surround sound mode is awesome for music, but is very weird for podcasts/videos, so I generally only use surround sound for music.\n\n\"Build quality is bad\". I haven't owned many pairs of headphones like this, but the build quality seems at least as good as previous pairs of Beats or Sennheiser headphones I've owned. Nevertheless, I went ahead and paid $30 for the 3 year Azurion warranty with Amazon, and plan to use that if there is ever an issue.\n\nOther thoughts:\n-Headphone range is good. I have not disconnected due to range a single time, and I've walked around my entire house (~1000 sqft) with these connected to my phone via bluetooth and my phone charging in another room.\n-USB-C is great. So glad I don't have to use some janky old cable.\n-Sound quality is good over bluetooth. I am definitely not an expert on sound quality, but I've primarily used these over bluetooth and have been consistently pleased with the sound quality.\n-Headphones are generally comfortable. My ears do not get hot or sweat at all when I wear these indoors. I've worn them on a couple walks outdoors in the Texas heat, and as you'd expect, they get a bit warmer and sweatier, but I would be shocked if they didn't. I think i have a medium to large sized head, and I don't get tired of wearing them.\n-Using ANC took some getting used to. I've never had a noise cancelling headphones before, so it did take a few days to adjust and feel like there wasn't pressure on my ears.\n-The \"optimizer\" in the app. I'm not sure how much this actually optimized the noise cancelling for my ears, but it seemed like a cool feature if it did work.\n\nOverall, I've had a great experience with these headphones so far. If you're like me and you read all the 1 star reviews before purchasing, take some of them with a grain of salt because a lot people clearly didn't even try to learn how to use their headphones, and complain about things they can change.",

      "title": "Masterpieces: A comparison between Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II",
      "body": "Around the holidays, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high quality headphones. I live in the central area of a major US city, and to be frank the noise pollution was driving me a little crazy. I was interested in a pair of headphones that would give me some peace and quiet, so I spent a lot of time looking at ANC (active noise-Cancelling) options and the Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II were easily the top picks among reviews.\n\nHowever, there were a lot of different opinions about which was better. The split was pretty 50/50 between the Sony and Bose, so I was pretty torn. Even though they were heavily discounted for the holidays ($300 each after taxes), that's a lot of money considering I generally never spend more than $50 for headphones. So I bought them both as an experiment, with the plan to return one after I made a decision.\n\nLet me get this out of the way now, because I'm going to get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, I understand why there's such a debate about whether the Sony or Bose is better. They are both fantastic headphones and I love them both. I love them so much, that I made the probably financially irresponsible decision to keep them both! They were both so good, but in better than the other in completely unique ways. For that reason, there is no dealbreaker that makes one better than the other -- I believe it comes down completely to personal preference and that's why there is so much debate on which is better.\n\nThe TL;DR of this review is that you should buy the Sony if you value sound quality most, and don't plan to wear them for long periods of time (i.e. over 5-6 hours per session). You should buy the Bose if you value comfort the most, and if you're planning to use them for phone calls.\n\nIf you're interested in a bit more detail, I'll give my opinions on these aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, Versatility\n\nANC\n\nThe noise-cancelling on both of these is phenomenal. I had assumed Bose would do better at this since it's what they're known for, but I'm surprised to say the Sony's ANC is slightly better. It does a bit better blocking out non-drone sounds (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared to the Bose. With that said, they both are practically equal and I don't think the Sony ANC is so much better than the Bose that it would justify buying them on that factor alone. When wearing either pair, I sometimes feel like a spaceman walking around my apartment because everything is so quiet.\n\nSOUND\n\nThis is a clear winner for Sony. No questions asked, the sound is clearer, crisper, and deeper. This is especially noticeable when watching movies/TV shows or playing video games. With the Sony, I feel like I can hear each individual sound clearly, whereas with the Bose everything is a little more muddled together. With that being said, the Bose sound is perfectly acceptable and even 'good'. It's just that for a $300 pair of headphones I'd expect a more premium quality where I am amazed at how clear the sound is. The Sony does that; the Bose are a tier below.\n\nCOMFORT\n\nHands down, the Bose are better. I can literally wear them for 14 hours and they don't bother me except for needing to give my ears a little air every once in a while. I have never, ever worn a pair of headphones this comfortable before. I'm especially grateful for this comfort now that I'm working from home all day because of COVID-19. The Sony headphones are a bit heavier and clamp on your head a little bit more tightly. They also press down on your ears, whereas the Bose are deep enough that my ears don't even touch the inside of the cans. The Sony are still definitely comfortable, but a tier below the Bose. I can still wear them for about 6 hours before they bother me, so if you don't wear headphones that long it might not be a problem for you.\n\nVERSATILITY\n\nThis is just a catch-all for all the other aspects of the headphones. Nothing here I would consider a selling point strong enough for most people to make a final decision, but if you have specific needs then this might be helpful.\n1. I like the physical buttons on the Bose more than the touch buttons on the Sony. They just work better, and I make mistakes with them less often.\n2. Sony has better technology. They use USB-C so the headphones charge faster than the Bose mini-hdmi. They also have better bluetooth connection technology, which lets a higher bitrate of audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting too technical, I think this is a major reason why the sound quality on the Sony is better.\n3. Bose is better if you want to connect to multiple devices. Bose can connect to two devices simultaneously, but Sony can connect to only 1 device at a time. For example, if I am listening to music on my computer and I get a phone call, if I'm wearing the Bose, I can answer and talk on the call through my headset, and when I hang up music will resume. With the Sony, I'd either have to disconnect from my computer, then reconnect to my phone before the call ended, or take off the headphones completely and answer the phone separately.\n4. Sony looks a little more stylish and futuristic. The Bose look like an ordinary pair of headphones. Build quality is identical though\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n5 months after buying these, do I regret keeping them both? NO! They are absolutely worth the money if you have it. Generally, I find that I wear the Bose throughout the day as I'm working from home. They're really comfortable to wear all day long, if I get a call from a co-worker I don't need to take them off, and I'm just listening to music as background noise while I work so sound quality isn't important. After dinner, it's always the Sony. When I'm focusing on a new album, watching a movie, or playing a video game, I really value how good the sound is. And generally I only wear them for 3-4 hours at this point so discomfort is never an issue.\n\nIf you twist my arm about it and made me pick only one pair to own the rest of my life? I'd probably take the Bose just because I wear them so much while working from home. But that's not a fair metric, and each individual will have a different primary purpose for these and that should be your guiding principal when making the choice.\n\nGood luck!

      "title": "A review from the average university student",
      "body": "So I am going to preface this by saying that if you are looking for audiophile grade cans, turn away now. Go get a pair of sennheisers and an amp.\nI am a student at the University of Central Florida, so I will be writing this for my university homies, hopefully this helps, and note my inexperience with every set in this class. I have only use the QC 35's and surface headphones briefly.\nSo basically, we've got 5 important things for these headphones, as compared to something like the Bose QC 35 series II, which are the other leading headphones in this segment and price range. Sound, comfort, quality and reliablity, features, battery life, and value. I use these almost all day with my OnePlus 6t and have no issues at all, and when I get home I plug the aux into my gaming PC and it works amazingly for gaming, music, and noise cancelling all around. Now, for the specifics:\n\nSound - 10/10 - The sound is great, very punchy bass as one would expect, while still keeping clarity in the mids and highs. Honestly its a pair of headphones the average person would absolutely love. I wont even put the likes of beats or anything in here because they don't compare. I know some have complained about the sound quality not being as balanced as the Bose QC 35 series II, but I also want to counter that by saying that the Sony app has an equalizer built in that really helps balance out the sound. When I hook them up to my computer, the EQ on my soundcard allows me to make them sound natural, and does not make the sound feel very fake, as it happens when you mess with the natural sound of headphones. Honestly just a great sound and fantastic listening experience.\n\nComfort - 8/10 - There isn't much to say here, the Bose QC 35 series II would be an easy 10/10 here. Those feel like you are wearing pillows. As a Florida man, it gets pretty hot here, and my ears do sweat when wearing the XM3's. Apart from the sweating (which never happens to me if I'm not outside in the heat), they are super comfortable. And they even keep your ears warm when it's colder outside, they're like earmuffs.\n\nQuality and reliability - 7/10, ?/10 - This was a tough one, since I have not had them for very long. Its been about 3 weeks now and they are already creaking and making sounds when I move them around, though they do feel very nice to touch and though they are made of primarily plastic, the quality of the headphones is pretty good. I can't give a reliability score because I am not sure whether these will have the headband snapping issue that the previous versions have had, but the creaking is not a good sign. If you're going to buy these, buy the protection plan.\n\nFeatures - 10/10 - Great features! I can't say enough good about the features for these headphones. Noise cancellation is the best in the segment, works without even having to be connected to bluetooth. The Sony app gives you TWENTY ONE LEVELS of noise cancellation. It's absolutely insane, and it works so incredibly well. I honestly can't hear a thing with the noise canceling on and music at about 30%. If i'm too lazy to take them off in class, I just turn the noise cancelling down to 16 (open mics) and can hear my professors very well. The touch pad controls are weird at first, but I have gotten used to them and they work consistently. Putting my hand over the earcup comes in handy when ordering food or thanking my shuttle driver, since it instantly turns off the noise cancellation and opens the mics so you can hear. Best features in the segment, amazing for use at university, and easy to use and control. The case for these is also great, and is very good at keeping the headphones safe and tucked away.\n\nBattery life - 10/10 - Can't argue with the battery life on these. 10 minues and you get 5 hours of playback time with noise cancellation on and they will even charge to full in around 3 hours, which is absolutely mad. (Tested with a wall plug and charger, not on a laptop/PC). USB type C, which some care about, I do. Best battery in the segment, and I really have no complaints.\n\nValue - 7/10 - Being the best headphones in this segment isn't easy. I can't give this a higher score because of reliability issues that have happened in the past, along with the creaking I am currently experiencing, but if it wasn't for reliability issues this would be an easy 9/10. The fact that one would also feel inclined to buy the 3 or 4 year warranty because of these reliability questions also knocks off a point. But these are definitely best in class, and even better if you can catch them on sale.\n\nTl;dr, great headphones. Would recommend them if you're a university student who travels on shuttle or bus, or if you just like to isolate yourself and listen to music, podcasts, or videos in crowded or noisy places. They charge fast, sound great, are comfortable enough, and have best in class features. If comfort and pure sound are your two priorities and you don't care about extreme noise cancellation, usb C charging, don't want to spend ~$15 on a 4 year warranty, and don't care at all about modern features, get the Bose QC 35.",

      "title": "Bose has been decisively dethroned (Update)",
      "body": "I currently own about 30 headphones of various brands and types. I have tried many Bluetooth headphones and own the Bose QC35 II and Bowers and Wilkins PX. I bought both the Sony WH-1000x MKI & MKII but returned them after weighing the shortcomings vs the cost, my main complaints being comfort and sound (the ANC was always good). My portable-everyday-beat-them-up headphones were the Bose QC 35 II. I liked them primarily for the comfort and ANC. The sound on the Bose can best be described as adequate but generally lifeless. Always in search of something better I read a couple of “First Look” articles about the Sony WH-MX1000M3 and decided to pull the plug on the first day that they were available on Amazon. When I received the Sony’s I was pleased to see that the case was similar to the Bose QC 35, a little bigger but shaped well enough to fit comfortably in my backpack. When I removed the headphones and put them on my head I realized immediately that these would be as comfortable as the Bose. Good job Sony.\n\nAfter charging for a couple of hours I paired them to my phone and went to my headphone test playlist on Spotify. My main complaint with the previous Sony model's sound was that they had very little soundstage (defined as perceived distance between your ears and the music) and little definition (defined as the clarity and separation of the various instruments in a piece of music). The M3 sounded better than the previous Sony’s and better than the Bose, but the highs appeared to be quite subdued and overwhelmed by the bass. This was disappointing.\nBut, Sony has a phone app that allows for EQ so I go download the app. Frustration. The app did not recognize the MK3. Patience. I figure that Sony has not updated the app yet. So I wait a day and see that the Sony app has automatically updated on my phone. I open and hurray! It is recognizing the MK3 now. Now I can play with EQ: -1 on 400 Hz. +1 on 1K. +2 on 2.5K. +3 on 6K. +4 on 16K and “Clear Bass” remains at 0. Play music and now were talking! I’m not going to say that these sound nearly as good as most of my wired headphones, but for everyday-on-the-go-beat-them-up-with-ANC these are exciting. They blow the Bose away. The Bowers and Wilkins PX which weigh about three times more than the Sony’s have decent BT sound when the ANC is off but the sound changes considerably and not for the better when you apply one of three ANC modes. They PX is OK for about an hour of no ANC listening while sitting at home, but after that my ears and the top of my head hurt.\n\nThe noise cancellation of the Sony is a generation ahead of Bose. There, I said it. Most reviewers crown the Bose as the best ANC you can get. Well, Sony has just showed Bose that they are the new big boy on the block. I did some A/B comparisons with both headphones and realized that the Sony not only cancels steady noise like jet engines or the sound of the air conditioning intake in my condo, but it does a great job of virtually eliminating all other sounds, including television voices and even other people, as my wife can attest to when she had to stand in front of me and wave her hands to get my attention because I could not hear her talking (so, if you want to block out your wife’s talking… LOL!). And this is without even messing with the settings in the app. Others reviewer here have not had the same experience, stating that it does not cancel voices. I frankly did not expect it to cancel voices, but I must say that the Sony comes as close as anything I have ever not heard.\n\nSo, if you want very comfortable headphones with the best sound and Active Noise Cancelling that you can expect with wireless Bluetooth in 2018 get these. They will not sound as good as wired closed back or open back headphones, but “you can’t always get what you want”, “nothing is perfect”, and “everybody is different”.\n\nIn addition to the Sony WH-1000XM3 during this review period I used:\nBose QC 35 II\nBowers & Wilkins PX\nBang and Olufsen H6 (wired)\nSennheiser HD650 (wired)\nAKG 7KXX (wired)\nSpotify\nFlac files on phone and desktop computer\n\nUPDATE 2018-09-21: I did experience an issue with phone calls where people at the other end were hearing an echo of their voice. I tested the headphones with three different phones and the problem occurred with all three. So I replaced them through Amazon. I am glad to say that the new pair does not have the issue. After some tests with phone calls I will say that Sony still needs to do some work on the call quality at the other end of the call (the call sounds fine in the Sony itself). In this regard, the Bose QC 35 is better. I think the call quality is really with the sound processing that Sony has implemented and not the hardware. Hopefully this will be improved in future firmware upgrades. Another minor con that the Bose handles better is the support for multiple BT sources. But this is a minor annoyance and I only use the Sony's for my phone anyway, so I am not constantly switching sources. Small price to pay for better ANC and musical sound.",

      "title": "Definitely the best of the current \"Big Three\"...",
      "body": "The Sony WH1000XM3 headphones are 1/3 of THE trifecta of wireless headphones, including the Sony offering, the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones, and the Bose QC35-II headphones. I have been able to try all three, and can say that the Sony headphones are the winner for me.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n(1) I really only have found one and it's rather glaring -- these headphones can only be paired with one device at a time. Meaning that if you've already paired them with your phone, when you want to use them with your laptop you have to completely go through the pairing process all over again. And once you have it paired with your laptop and want to go back to your phone, you have pair everything all over again. I really can't believe Sony botched this feature this badly, and I really don't know what they were thinking.\n\nA minor negative is that the Sony headphone app is not compatible with Android on Chromebooks. Although I have a monster bulky Asus ROG gaming laptop, I mainly use my Acer Chromebook while on the go, and although the Chromebook runs Google Play Android apps, the Sony headphone app reports that it's not compatible with this device. So when using these headphones with my Chromebook, they're aren't anywhere near as tweakable as when I'm using it on my phone. I'm sure it would work with a genuine Android tablet, but I don't use Android tablets anymore since I got the Chromebook.\n\nAnother minor annoyance is the tiny little 6\" (at best) USB-C charge cable that Sony includes. It's just simply not convenient to charge these headphones on such a short cord, and it really would've only cost Sony maybe pennies to include a more standard 3' cord.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n(1) These headphones are very comfortable to wear, even for longer periods of time. They are just slightly less comfortable than the Bose QC35-II headphones, which feel like magical unicorn sparkle angel pillows on your ears.\n\n(2) A big thumbs up for future-proof USB-C charging! I haven't found any other brand of higher end headphone using it yet, so I suspect that Sony is the first.\n\n(3) The ANC feature is superb -- definitely equal to, if not actually superior to, the Bose QC35-II headphones. And the app makes it even better by allowing you to tweak it to your personal preferences.\n\n(4) Another big thumbs up for Sony making the wired cord 3.5mm to 3.5mm rather than having a more proprietary (and difficult to replace) 2.5mm on one end. Again, I'm pretty sure Sony is the only one doing this in higher end headphones for some reason.\n\n(5) Sound quality is excellent and in direct comparison I think it's better than the Bose QC35-II. I realize this is rather subjective, though, but I really have nothing negative to say about Sony's sound quality, whereas I felt the Sennheiser PXC550 sound quality was rather poor.\n\n(6) Sony put the right amount of touch controls and hardware buttons on these headphones. One thing I really didn't like about the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones is that they didn't have a hardware on/off switch and instead the power option is built-in to rotating the ear cups. That just seemed like something that would quickly break and I also never did figure out how I was supposed to turn off the headphones while still using them wired. There's simply no way to turn them off. Sony has a dedicated hardware power button, as well as a multi-function button that can be setup (via the app) to control ANC or digital assistants, etc. So far I haven't had any problems with accidentally activating a touch function. Volume, skip, and pause touch functions have all been very responsive.\n\n(7) Although I'm not using the included case (I bought a 3rd-party case that I like better), it's still a really nice case. I think the Bose case is nicer, but the Sennheiser case was just pathetic and wasn't much better than a bag in terms of protecting the rather expensive headphones.\n\nOverall, without getting into too many specifics about the other two headphones, I rate the Sony headphones as the best for me. The slightly beat out the Bose QC35-II headphones in terms of ANC as well as sound quality, and there's simply no comparison when it comes to Sony's touch controls and superior USB-C charging. The difference between the Sony headphones and the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones was like night and day. The Sennheisers had vastly inferior sound quality and horrible comfort to the point that I couldn't even really test/compare the ANC because there's simply no way I could keep the Sennheisers on my head long enough (the ear cups are actually painful). It was also a nice touch that the Sony headphones came to me fully charged, whereas the Bose and Sennheiser headphones were only partially charged. Who wants to wait to fully charge their new device?\n\nSo, in summary, the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones slightly nudge out the Bose QC35-II headphones, whereas the Sony headphones obliterate the Sennheiser PXC550 headphones so badly that they really aren't even in the same category.",

      "title": "Everything you need to know...",
      "body": "I recently discovered the importance of owning a top-quality set of wireless noise-cancelling headphones after moving to New York City last fall. Walking the streets and riding the subway day in and day out becomes an altogether different experience when you can escape into your own world of music, audiobooks, or even just the relative silence offered by ANC headphones. Before purchasing the 1000XM3s, I had some junky wireless earbuds that, at the time, I thought sounded pretty good. I was WRONG! Compared to the 1000XM3s, I might as well have had a pair of tin cans strapped to my head.\n\nIf you are reading this review and are seriously considering these headphones, then you have likely read other reviews and already know they are in the top of their class in terms of sound quality. I had planned to use them primarily during my commutes but have since found myself wearing them throughout the day. I have rediscovered my music collection, am hearing things I’ve never heard before, blah blah blah…all those wonderful things people say after switching to some expensive speakers/headphones. But it’s true, they sound GOOD! As you’ve probably also already heard, they do not have a perfectly flat response. They are a slightly bass-heavy, which is fine, even preferably for most of what I listen too.\n\nIf the bottom-heavy response is holding you back, the Sony Headphones app offers adjustable EQ with factory and customizable user presets. Additionally, you can select multiple “surround” settings as well as sound position controls, neither of which are very useful in my opinion. More important to me was the LDAC and Aptx-HD codec support. I’ll admit, it took me a couple days to figure out how to get these things to run LDAC with my Samsung Note 8, however, once I got it working, I absolutely noticed improved quality over the default SBC codec. Unfortunately, using LDAC requires operating in “priority on sound quality” mode which disables the surround, position, and equalizer functions. Fortunately for me, I am not particularly interested in these options anyway. At least these things support high quality codecs in the first place, unlike Bose.\n\nYou know what else Bose headphones don’t have? USB type-C! While this was initially not a major selling point for me, after using them every day, I am grateful for the faster charging of the type-C format. A ten-minute charge (or less) almost always gets me back to 100%. Not that I really need it. These headphones last FOREVER. The longest I have continuously used them was about 8 hours (with ANC on). Afterwards, I tapped the power button and the sexy Sony woman voice said, “about 70% battery remaining”. Extrapolating from that, the advertised 30-hour battery life seems accurate.\n\nNoise-cancelling is great! I don’t know what else to say. It’s not 100%. Obnoxiously loud people will still be faintly audible, but otherwise, pretty much all of the outside world is effectively cancelled out. I have not tried Bose ANC headphones or previous Sony models, but basically all reviewers say that the 1000-XM3s are the best on the market and I have no reason to believe otherwise. Also note, the Headphones app allows for customizable levels of noise-cancelling. There is an adaptive noise-cancelling feature which will adjust this setting after automatically detecting whether your are sitting, walking, running, or in transit. I have chosen to disable this as I prefer full noise cancelling 100% of the time. But I do see the value in this feature. Hopefully I won’t unknowingly walk out in front of a bus.\n\nI basically love everything about these headphones. Even the hard case feels luxurious and is literally as compact and thin as they could have possibly made it – an important feature for those of us who carry bags around all day with limited space! My only complaint is that they do not support multiple simultaneous Bluetooth connections, that is, I cannot connect my laptop and phone at the same time - a minor issue considering it takes only 10 seconds to manually switch between devices.\n\nAnyway, I hope this review will be helpful to those on the fence. I spent days researching these damn things before pulling the trigger. They aren’t cheap for good reason; some serious top-notch engineering went into these headphones. You will not be disappointed!",

      "title": "Great Performer with Few Shortcomings",
      "body": "Quick Summary: (4/5)\n\nThe Sony WH-1000XM3 is a great pair of headphones that hold their own against the tenured Bose. The Sony's provide a fun and full listening experience to a wide array of music genres that will make most perfectly content with their purchase. Bose's QC headphones will provde a more refined and pleasent listening experience especially for the discerning listener and will provide a stronger noise cancelling performance in a home or office setting. The stronger sound signature of the Sony will hold out better in a lounder atmosphere such as a plane, train, or automobile with its stronger bass performance. The Sony's lack the grace and balance of the QCs, but will provide a more familiar experience to the majority of listeners and will appeal more to someone who likes the sound of Apple's Beats, but is looking for a more professional or subtle design.\n\nFull Review:\n\nFor the Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350), I will primarily compare it to the Bose Quiet Comfort (QC)($350) since even though they are all in the same relative price range, they are technically closer in price and age. I will also provide a little comparison to Bose's NC700 ($400) and Sennheiser's Momentum ($400) in the summary. Also, I will primarily discuss the pair of headphones in question and how it relates feature-wise to the Bose's Quiet Comfort (not QCII) headphones while refraining from giving too many details about the others, since you can read more specifically about those pairs individually in the review posted under their respective products. The reason for that is mainly to keep the review from becoming a master's thesis in subjective preferences. :)\n\nInitial Impression:\n\nStarting with the packaging. Simple and straight forward. The outer shell has a nice texture to it, but sliding out the insert with the headphones in it reveals a very simple package structure made up of just the case holding the headphones inside a box. However, the case itself feels really nice and has a sleek color palette. Very appealing to feel and look at in my opinion. Although the case is a touch bigger than the one for Bose's QC, it does a better job of holding its headphones. The QC's case always feels uncomfortably tight when putting them away. Sony's case neatly holds everything comfortably (without having to squish them in to zip it closed). The case is stiff, but not really hard. The inside is the same as the QCs with a soft microfiber feel to it. The headphones fold up inside with three little slots to the right for (inside to outside) the airplane adapter, 3.5mm aux cord, and USB Type-C charger cable.\n\nThe Headphones:\n\nWhen I first picked them up out of the case, they felt nice. Soft plastic with a good feel to them. The plastic has a sparkle to it with a matte finish that resists fingerprinting decently. The band of leatherette on top is soft and has good cushion. Similarly around the ear cups. Very soft and nice to the touch. Not as stiff as the QCs. The click of the band when expanding it is satisfyingly stiff. At the top of both ear cups, you can see one of the microphones in a rose gold finish. Some other smaller holes are hidden around more subtly for the NC array. I feel this is a minor plus for the Sonys. The QC's microphones are a little more prominent and pick up wind a lot more outside. The USB Type-C port is at the bottom of the right cup with an indicator light. The left cup has the power button along the bottom back with the button for toggling the noise cancelling level just above it. Inside the ear cups, there is microfiber layer covering the drivers over a layer of foam. Overall the Sony's feel a little lighter than the QC's but also feel just slightly more flimsy when handling them. But the design is also more appealing and fluid and frankly more premium.\n\nWhen comparing the headphones while putting them on, the QC again feel more snug and naturally isolating before turning them on. The cups feel like they form a better seal given the stiffer covers and the QC also have angled drivers that leave natural room for your ears inside the cup, making the headphones not feel like they are sitting on your ears, but rather around them. The Sony are by no means uncomfortable, but may tend to be less comfortable for longer wear times and might make your ears prone to getting hotter.\n\nSound Quality:\n\nFor starters in this section, I will compare the noise cancelling. Upon turning the Sonys on, you are greeted by a woman's voice that sounds like it is in a tin can or cave when she speaks. When the NC kicks in, it does a darn good job of removing ambient sound and muffling people talking somewhat. It feels very close to the NC of the QCs, but I would still give them a leg up because the Sonys have a much more noticeable white noise factor playing whereas the QC feel more like they just sucked the sound out of the atmosphere around you. For the traveling folk (I primarily wear them in a typical office setting which any of these work plenty well for), I would say given the more aggressive, forward, pronounced sound stage with the Sonys, you will find them blocking sound better in a car or plane without the sound (especially on the lower, bass end) being washed out. The QCs have better NC, but the sound is softer in general so the sound still gets overwhelmed in a car/plane. I am not saying the NC is not doing its job, just that what you are left with is weaker with the QCs because the sound itself is subtler and more refined so you have to turn them up louder to make up for this.\n\nNow, it is difficult to judge sound since it is so subjective, but I will try to give my own impression of what each headphone may be better for. I listen to a wide range of genres, so I can appreciate many styles of music and how they are represented by different types of headphones and speakers. First, the Sonys bring a more forward sound. The sound stage isn't as wide as the QCs. Instruments get mixed together and lost in the fray. The sound of the Sonys feels more akin to that of Beats Studio. The bass is more pronounced and punchy which may be more appealing to some. If you prefer a balanced and clean representation, the QCs will serve you better. As you turn the volume up, the Sonys also lose more of their balance and can become muddy. The QCs give more of an impression that the music is playing around you, while the Sonys just feel like they're playing music. (if you really want to feel like you are on stage with the music, Sennheiser's HD800S is king. The HD700 or HD660S do a good job too at a better price, but these are all studio headphones, so totally different use case to begin with.)\n\nWhere I really felt more of the performance shining through came in the Rap, R&B, or even some EDM/House area. I can definitely appreciate Sony more for some 2pac, Destiny's Child, Infected Mushroom, or Daft Punk. They are little too aggressive for music you may want a finer touch with such as jazz or opera. When listening to some Kenny G, David Benoit, or Keiko Matsui, you get that groove, but the fine details and intricacies of the instruments are sacrificed. Also, the sharp trills of the piano keys and saxophone are a bit much at higher volumes. The visceral in-your-face nature of the sound also makes them pretty fun for bands in the vein of Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch, Pantera, and Metallica. Going a bit further that direction, with the likes of Eluveitie and Slayer it will be more likely to give you a headache from the unsubdued highs and thrashing sounds. Taking a couple steps back and going for some more classic rock like the Eagles, Journey, Gerry Rafferty, etc., the QC will perform better, but they are fine with Sony's headphones. Finally, when listening to music with a gentler atmosphere like Norah Jones, Ray LaMontagne, Ludovico Einaudi, or Celtic Woman, I would have to give it to Bose's QCs again but the Sony did liven them up a bit in a way.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBoth Sony and QC have three levels of NC. High, Ambient sounds, and off. The QC handle this a lot better. The mid level for the Sony feels worthless and clumsy without audio playing. It almost sounds better being turned off. On the QC, the mid level provides a good balance and allows you to wear them outside on a windy day with reduced noise from the wind in the NC microphone. However, in the case of the QC (instead of the QCII), you need the app to change the NC level.\n\nThe QC claim 20 hours of battery, which I have thoroughly proven to be true in the years I have owned them. Sony's claim 30 hours, which I have also found to be true, but I haven't had them nearly as long to see how they hold up over time. Also having had the QCs for longer, I have had to replace the ear pads after about 2 years. This process was easy and made them feel and sound new again with the better seal of fresh pads. The process for both headphones appears to be the same.\n\nCall quality is great for both headphones. I also use them for Skype calls from my laptop at work where they work great. However, this is one of those places the Sony completely dropped the ball. Bose's QCs allow two devices connected at the same time, and you can switch seamlessly between them which makes them great for the office. I have them on the laptop and my phone at the same time. I can listen to music while working. When its meeting time, I just join the Skype call and it immediately picks up. If I get a call on my phone, it switches back over. When I am done, music is ready to go. I don't have to touch anything. Next time I turn them on, it picks backup to the laptop and my phone immediately.\n\nBoth charge fast. Just a few minutes will give me a couple hours of use in a pinch. Both also have apps. The Bose app is laid out better and more useful, but neither are really great or even necessary except in the case of the Bose being able to sync two pairs of Bose headphones to play the same music or audio through both. This may be a good deal for a couple seeking to both watch a movie on a plane or something. I have done this a couple times and it works well once setup. It is a nice feature in favor of Bose, but I haven't really found a lot of use for it in reality.\n\nFor the Sonys, you have the features with the right cup having touch controls. This is fairly slick and works better than I expected. It only took a couple attempts to get the hang of it and it is responsive. Swipe up and down for volume. Swipe left and right for skipping tracks. Double tap to play and pause. And finally, if you hold your fingers on the right ear cup, it will turn the volume down and turn on the external microphone to catch ambient sound if you need to talk to someone really quick without stopping your music. A nice feature, but I personally haven't found much use for it. Might be useful for people in a bigger city like NYC walking around with the headphones constantly and you don't want to take them off every time you need to listen for a moment.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSony's WH-1000XM3 are no slouch and stand up for themselves at this price range. For someone looking for a pair of headphones with solid noise cancelling, flexible and diverse performance across genres and premium features, you won't go wrong with these. I dock them to 4/5 stars simply because in my own opinion, they fall short of Bose's QC series at the same price range in the overall quality and balance of the sound, noise cancellation ability, and the ability to connect to two devices at once and seamlessly hand off between them which is extremely handy for business people in today's multi-device world. Now, for my brief mention of the slightly more expensive options in the Bose NC700 and Sennheiser Momentum. If you are willing to step just a bit further up to the $400 mark, you will get even better quality, better noise cancelation, more premium feel and just overall better devices. However, I will propose that with the Sony or Bose QCs, you would not go wrong. For the majority of people, I would not say the extra money is worth it for the marginal increase over these headphones. It will mostly come down to your preference in sound.\n\nI will try to keep these reviews updated as time goes on and if anything comes up. Feel free to ask any questions and I will give a response when I can.",

      "title": "Excellent Noise Cancellation, Great Sound Quality",
      "body": "I'll preface my review by stating that these are my first pair of bluetooth cans, as well as first pair with noise cancellation. I travel for work quite frequently and have been wanting a pair of noise cancelling headphones for quite some time. Like most, I was between the Bose QC35 ii's and these Sony WH-1000xM3s. I visited a local store and tried out both. My initial conclusion was that the Bose cans are more comfortable (lighter, deeper ear cups), but with weaker NC and a more neutral sound signature. I ended up ordering the Sony's and now have used them for 3-4 hours/day since receiving them.\n\nBuild Quality/Materials - Initial thoughts upon unboxing - these are solid. The soft touch plastics used feels durable and of good quality. These do not feel cheap to me whatsoever. The detents on the headband are well defined and feel like they'll hold up to daily adjustment. Sufficient padding on the headband as well. The ear cups are well padded and the synthetic leather feels of high quality. No creaking or odd sounds when flexing these way past what normal on/off the head use subjects them to. Only time will tell how these hold up to daily use, but I'm happy with the build quality out of the box.\n\nFit - I have a large head. I wear a size 7-5/8 fitted baseball cap. My longest continuous listening session with these thus far was ~4 hours. No major discomfort to report. I had no fatigue along my jawline from the ear cup clamping force, and zero discomfort along the crown of my head. I will say, my ears/head get warm with these on for extended periods of time, even while stationary. When moving around the house, I started to sweat a bit. I do tend to run hot but regardless, these are a warm set of cans. I do think these will be just fine for stationary use (such as on a plane) and that's how I intend to use them 95% of the time.\n\nNoise Cancellation - One word: Wow. As mentioned above, this is my first pair of headphones with noise cancellation. I fly a lot for work and wanted the best of the best in this category. My old Sennheiser HD 429s, which are over ear/closed back, but have no noise cancellation, only really drown out ambient noise when listening at 80+% volume, which is not ideal for hours long flights. After watching the numerous comparison review videos on YouTube, and trying both the Bose QC35 ii's and these cans in store, I feel I made the right choice. The noise cancellation is truly remarkable. The quick attention feature works great as well. I can cover the right ear cup and ambient noise/voices become almost immediately audible. I've tried the Ambient Sound Mode around the house and I will say, that even with \"Focus on Voice\" selected, I have a hard time hearing someone speaking to me if the music volume is above ~20%. I have a flight next week and will amend this section of my review after with my thoughts on the NC on a plane.\n\nSound Quality - I've been leary of bluetooth headphones for fear of sound degradation due to the wireless connection. My iPhone 8 Plus doesn't have a headphone jack and I've been forced to use the dongle to listen to my Sennheisers, which is less than ideal. After my first listening session with the Sonys, I can confidently say that to my untrained ears, the 1000xM3s absolutely blow my wired Sennheisers out of the water in terms of sound quality. Yes, these are 3x the cost, but I'm still incredibly impressed with the sound quality here. As others have mentioned, these were a bit bass heavy for my tastes out of the box. However, the Sony Connect app gives full EQ control over the sound profile of these cans. In my opinion, the user control available in the app truly pushes these headphones to the next level. Everyone's musical preference is different, and you have full control of the sound with this app. I'm all over the place with my music - from progressive jazz such as Pat Metheny, to the fast and furious riffs of Mastodon, to the undulating bass lines of Flamingosis and Jazzinuff. These headphones deliver! The bass is punchy (and heavy at the upper EQ levels), mids and highs come through prominently and clear, and the soundstage is spot on for my ears.\n\nPairing & Battery Life - After unboxing, I powered on the headphones and connected them to my iPhone. Pairing was quick and painless. Battery life was at 60% out of the box. I plugged them into a 5V, 1.5 amp power adapter for 10 minutes, using the included USB-C cable, and the headphones were bumped up to 80% battery level. It seems the quick charge claims of 5 hours playback in 10 minutes of charge are valid. I've since listened to them for a total of ~15 hours, and the battery level is showing 30%. The battery level changes in 10% increments. So for my use case, 50% battery loss over 15 hours of listening = 30 hours assumed playback with a full charge. Bang on to Sony's claims. All of my listening has been with Noise Cancelling active, and anywhere from 30 - 70% volume. I'll top these up to 100% battery prior to travelling and will report back with observed battery life for a full charge.\n\nIncluded Accessories - The carrying case is what I expected. I see it holding up to travel just fine. The internal cable pocket is a bit tight but fits the included cables without much fuss. The included USB-C cable is shorter than I'd like, but seems to be of good quality. The included 3.5mm cable has a straight male connector at one end (for connection to the headphones) and a 90 degree connector at the opposite end. It's an acceptable length.\n\nOther Notes - I've yet to make or receive a phone call with these on. One of the most talked about negatives, at least in the reviews I've read, is how poor the microphone quality is on these headphones. I don't ever plan to take phone calls with these on, so this was never a factor in my purchasing consideration for these. But, I'm sure at some point I'll test out the mic and will report back. Lastly, single device connectivity - I only ever listen to music from my phone so this is another non issue for me. Just to try it out, I did switch listening from my phone to my laptop, and it took maybe 45 seconds to disconnect from one device, connect to the other and then start playing music again.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm VERY impressed with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top notch, sound quality for a music enthusiast (read: NOT an audiophile) is excellent, the Sony Connect app is feature rich and gives the user full control, the carrying case is sufficient/in line with other headphones of this class and the build quality is great as well. Only time and use will tell how these hold up in the long run, but so far, these are hands down the best headphones I've ever had the pleasure of owning.",

      "title": "Sony Vs Bose Vs Beats Vs Utaxo Vs...",
      "body": "I'm not writing this review for any type of financial gain and I bought the headphones for market value. Naturally the opinions expressed are mine and my audio preferences may differ from yours. I have a pretty good ear for sound and have a background in home theater and audio sales and setup. Now for the review.\nAfter reading many reviews and doing more research than was probably needed I decided that Sony and Bose were the top 2 contenders. My wife had recently bought on Amazon the Utaxo, which have good reviews, are cheaper, and when I took them on a flight I was satisfied with their performance (for the price) and without a comparison to other headphones. I abused BestBuy and their return policy and purchased the Sony and the Bose. In the store I sampled the SkullCandy and they sounded bass-heavy and not clear, so I didn't include them. I also looked at the Jabra's, but after reviews believed they wouldn't be as good and left them out as well. So, I decided on the top 2 contenders and then the\nBeats because I see so many people wearing them, and the Utaxo for those looking for a budget set. I created a spreadsheet to help guide me and used it loosely. I attached it so you can see a little of what I was testing.\nIf you want the quick and dirty, I'd go with the Sony. Bose is 2nd. Beats 3rd. Utaxo 4th, but a good product for the price.\nYears ago I was in search of good wired headphones and compared the Audio Technica m50x against Monster, Senneheiser, Beyerdynamic, Monster, Sol, VModa, SkullCandy and a few others. I ended up with the Audio Technica (AT), and I mention that so you know my sound preference. I like more of a neutral sound with full range vs too bright or too bass heavy. Let's start the review. Here are the more detailed reasons for each headphone and why I chose them...\n\nComfort: Bose wins here but marginally. Most headphones irritate me to some extent as did the Bose, but Sony was a close second. Beats were about as comfortable as my Audio Techica's (AT), which aren't horrible by and means and Utaxo was basically tied with beats. Both moderately comfortable and I did wear the Utaxo's for an entire flight without taking them off. (4 hour flight)\n\nPassive Isolation: I used various white noise, airplane sound, background voices. Again, Bose has the slight edge with Beats trailing. Utaxo were comfortable enough, but by comparison, last place. Utaxo were comparable to my AT's, which I didn't realize how little they block out. Not great.\n\nActive Noise Reduction: I placed Bose first, but only by a hair. I had my family try the comparisons and some chose Sony, some chose Bose. They reduce at different frequencies so you can hear some sounds more on each, depending on the background noise. Both are excellent. Beats again comes in 3rd and wasn't a close third. Utaxo did a moderate job, and as I said, I was happy using them on the plane but didn't have anything to compare to. For a budget set they do the job. The winners and absolutely impressive are Bose and Sony. Maybe a tie.\n\nSound: This is probably the most important aspect of any headphone to me. I spent hours listening to different types of music. I had cables connected to each headphone and could quickly go back and forth between each. No, I couldn't put an SPL meter on each time to ensure the volume was exact but I did use the same source material and feel I have a pretty good feel for how they all sound. In the end, this is why I kept the Sony's. They aren't perfect and they aren't audiophile quality but they are really good. The most similar to my AT's. I found the Bose to be very sibilant at times with female vocals or tracks that had high frequencies in them. It happened time and time again and was the deal breaker for me with the Bose. Sony was more neutral, had adequate bass but didn't over-emphasize the higher tones. Less ear fatigue for me in the long-run. Beats were better than I was expecting. They also had some tendencies to boost the higher tones but had good bass. The Utaxo were good enough but just not impressive. Again, I was fine with them when I had no comparison but head to head they just don't compare favorably. The Sony app also has an equalizer feature that is super quick and easy to use, has some fun (not very useful) things like surround sound, soundstage localization, and a few other somewhat gimmicky features, but is much better than the Bose.\n\nFeatures: I didn't test the voice features on any of the headsets. It isn't that important to me. After using the Sony's for a few weeks, I do like the touch feature and the ability to hear ambient sound by placing your hand over the right ear cup. I also enjoy the Sony app, whereas the Bose app was lacking. Bose has the traditional buttons for volume which work fine but I did prefer the Sony touch interface more. Utaxo has standard buttons as well as the Beats, all work as intended.\n\nConclusion: The Sony and the Bose are very close and though the Bose may be slightly more comfortable, the features and especially the Sound on the Sony pushed me towards them. The ability to equalize on the fly very easily is a great feature that Sony includes in the app. The touch interface is more user friendly than Bose or the others. Beats are a fine set but I'd pay the extra $70 for the Sony. If you find a pair at a great price, you wouldn't be disappointed. The Utaxo, at around $60, are a bargain and a good set of headphones. If you never have a chance to compare you would likely be satisfied with them. They are built well, are comfortable enough and put out good enough sound to enjoy music and video. But they do place a distant 4th in terms of isolation. First Place: Sony !!",

      "title": "Sony's ANC Flagship for a good reason",
      "body": "I will preface this review by stating that I own and have reviewed a great number of headphones in the past. It does not make me neither an audiophile nor an expert but it still gives me a lot of good reference.\nFor each use, there must be a type of headphone. If you care about only the review of the Sony WH1000XM3, you can skip the following explanations.\n\nOpen, Semi-Open or Closed headphones, what is that?\n- Open headphones are good for audiophile uses. It will yield the most fidelity to the sound but these headphones are generally meant for quiet rooms, for being used with an ampli and a DAC and for a very good audio source. These headphones will also give you the largest soundstage (the impression that the music comes from the room itself).\n- Closed headphones are meant to be used in noisy environments. They usually do not give you the best soundstage but you can still get a good sound. They will have much less sound leakage than the open ones.\n- There is also semi-Open which is a trade of between the two above.\n\nIntra-Auricular, Around your ears, on-ears, earbuds, what is that?\n- There are much different formats of headphones.\n- Intra-Auricular are the ones that go into your ear canal. They usually need a good seal to provide the best sound, especially bass. They will be the ones blocking the outside sound the best.\n- Earbuds are usually more generic buds like the ones that come with your phone. Usually their quality is not fantastic, except rare exceptions. Their price is generally low.\n- On-ears are headphones where the cans are going on your ear. They can sometimes not be too comfortable due to pressure on your ears but they are usually quite light.\n- Around your ears are headphones with very large cans that will encompass your ears completely. That is usually the category of preference for Audiophiles due to the large size of the drivers (50mm).\n\nThen you have the connection to the sound source:\n- Wired: the oldest and simplest one. Some have a remote and mic, some do not. Historically these are the ones giving you the best chance to have an optimal sound quality.\n- Bluetooth are wireless headphones that need power to work (batteries). The sound quality and battery life has greatly improved in the most recent years. Yet, a wired headphone will usually deliver the best sound.\n\nLast is the noise cancellation:\n- ANC: Active Noise Cancellation is a complex algorithm that select the frequency bands to “Make disappear” to allow you to listen your music in the best conditions. Although this technology has greatly improved, the resulting sound quality will never be as good as without ANC due to the difficulty in not cutting frequencies that were part of the music. Another misunderstanding is that ANC does not cancel voices so you will still hear babies crying in the plane, and even better than without it.\n- Passive isolation: Is usually achieved by intra-auricular buds that work as earplugs. On the ears headphones can also have a fair isolation due to the thickness of the earpads.\n\nThe Sony WH1000XM3 falls into the ANC Wireless Over the ears category.\n\nNow onto the Sony WH1000XM3.\n\nAs I stated, I own a very large collection of headphones, enough to last more than one lifetime so I have stopped buying more, except for when I feel like I could get a real benefit from one.\nIt was the case for the Sony because I fly international regularly and it is always good to have a good noise cancellation in the plane when your trip last more than 8 hours.\nI had another passenger letting me try his pair at my request and I was favorably impressed by the comfort and noise isolation so I decided to indulge.\n\nHere is what I like about it:\n- Amazing comfort. I have no idea what the earpads are made of but it is a true pleasure wearing them. The pads wrap neatly around my ears with very little pressure on them, the top band does not put too much pressure either.\n- Best ANC I have ever experienced. The difference prior to turn it on and after is nothing short of amazing.\n- Very good sound. The Bass will please bassheads (listening to All the Stars from Kendrick Lamar and the bass is blasting my eardrums). The mids are very good too… The highs may be the least impressive but the sound is overall excellent.\n- Fair price. I own more expensive headphones that are not as comfortable, do not have ANC and do not sound as good…\n- Good app. Easy to configure. Pairing was easy\n- Nice carry case with everything you need while flying.\n- Battery life is of about 30 hours when in use. It will decrease slowly when not used but not by much.\n- The controls are very nice too. I love the cupping of one ear to allow a temporary muting of the sound to discuss or listen without turning it off or removing it.\n\nHere is what I like less:\n- Absolutely nothing!\n\nIn conclusion:\nA resounding 5 stars.\nThis headset is not only good for travelling but at work too and even at home…. Love it!",

      "title": "As good as promised in the reviews, BUT!",
      "body": "I purchased these headphones after seeing a lot of reviews online and because it was on sale. I couldn't help it. I've tested them for a couple of weeks now, and I think I can give a good review by now.\n\nThey replaced my Bose QC25 headphones that I loved but that I wished to be wireless from time to time. Since I've used those headphones for years, my review is comparison between the two brands and is probably going to be helpful for people that are deciding between these and the Bose QC35 II (please note that every other headphone in this price range is just pale compared to these). Also, I don't know much about Bose 700 since I haven't tested them extensively, but most of the things that apply for their older version is probably true for these as well.\n\nThe Negatives:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Not as comfortable. They are very comfortable, but not as much as Bose. After a while I can feel them in the top of my head and I do feel the headphones in my ears. Bose are almost perfect here; I can use them for hours and hours and only get hot in the ears if the day is really warm.\n- A little loose. The clamping force is a little lacking. When looking down or headbanging you can feel them move around and even fall. I didn't have this issue with Bose.\n- Earpiece cushions harder to replace than Bose. After over a year of use my Bose cushions started wearing down until they finally broke. After a $12 dollar replacement purchase, I easily replaced them and they were as good as new. I don't know how much it'll take for these cushions to wear down, but when they do, it's going to be much harder AND expensive to replace (I've found the replacement cushions at $50 and I've been told they are not as good affecting the noise cancelling quality).\n- Single button to turn on, off and get into pairing mode. It's not a major issue, but having to press for two seconds to turn on/off and seven to get into pairing mode is not great. With Bose after a while you automate the motion of removing and turning of the headphones in one move. I've forgotten to turn these off more often than not because of that which of course impacts battery usage since they are on while they are still connected to a device. You basically waste hours of battery because of this. Pressing for two seconds might not sound awful, but it's that compared to a switch interaction of instant results.\n- Bluetooth management!!!! This is were this headphones are really poor compared to Bose. They cannot connect to several devices at once, and to switch you must somehow cut the connection with the other device. So, to connect to a device you had already connected to, you need to manage at least 2 devices but most often that not 3. You need to cut the connection from the headphones to the previous device (either turn off the device's Bluetooth or press the On/Off button for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode) and then grab the other device and connect them to the headphones. Bose products have a memory of connections, once connected, the device will remember and to connect to a device you only need to single press the Bluetooth button; the headphones will announce a device name, and if you wait the headphone will connect to the device (as long as it has Bluetooth on of course). If you deal with several devices at once like phones, tablets and computers, Bose approach is unquestionably better; if you only use one device or don't mind using the cord for the others, this is no real issue. For me, if I had known, it would have probably been a deal breaker. I just thought that Bose's way was the standard. Also... Bose products connect to 2 devices simultaneously.\n\nThe Great and awesome:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+ Sound quality! In general very similar to the QC series, but with better base. These sound slightly better than Bose which is an impressive feat. Getting either one of these headphones spoil you and ruin every other headphone.\n+ USB-C for rapid charging. It's great to know that little time of charging will allow you to use the headphones for a very decent amount of time. Probably more than necessary until there's actually time to properly charge them.\n+ Touch controls for Media controls are really great. That is way more comfortable than having to double or triple press a button to do a trivial task.\n+ Standard 3.5mm headphone jack!!!! It may sound stupid, but it's great to know that you are guaranteed an easy and quick replacement for the cable if needed. Cables should be able to provide even better sound quality than the best Bluetooth transmission algorithms. Weather that's noticeable with this headphones I don't know. But you can get a cord as long as you want for this headphones whereas with Bose you are basically stuck with the provided length since they use a 2.5mm jack.\n+ Outstanding noise-cancelling capabilities. Probably the best I've experienced so far.\n+ Outstanding Battery life! Batteries were never an issue for me with the Bose because I had 4 rechargeable batteries that I rotated fairly easily. The battery included with these headphones lasts a really long time (20 to 30 hours) so I don't usually find myself in the need of recharging them when I wanted to use them the most.\n+ I'm not going to continue describing good things, because that's what the product description is for.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "title": "Relatively Nice Pair of headphones",
      "body": "I purchased these headphones and tried them out for about 2 weeks. I was upgrading from the Bose Soundlink 2s and was looking for headphones with noise cancellation.\n\nI have to say that I really, really wanted to love these headhphones but could not bring myself to keep them.\n\n-Features-\nPROS\n-USB C- Huge plus as I dont really have anything that charges with micros USB at this point. So definitely saves me from having to carry a micro USB cable for a single device. USB C is also a more robust connection when compared to micro USB and far less likely to wear out/break\n-ANC- The auto noise cancellation in the MX3s is definitely top of the line. The MX3s did a great job at cutting out office chatter and background noise. Realistically when I was playing music as low to medium volume I could not hear a single thing outside of my music.\n-Touchpad control- These worked very well, I especially like the cover right earcup to cancel ANC\n-NFC pairing- very quick and painless pairing\n-Sony MX3 App- The app was very cool with tons of customization possible\nCONS\n-ANC- The ANC is top of the line but realistically I was not BLOWN AWAY by it when compaired to the Bose QC35 IIs. switching back and forth between the MX3s and the QC35 IIs left no difference between the two that I could discern.\n-Only able to pair to one device at a time. This is such a massive shortcoming for a $350 device. Some people will not find this to be a problem, and I must admit that I thought I could work around it. However, after trying them out I simply found this to be unacceptable. I work in an office setting and wear my headphones for give or take 6 hours a day. I have spotify going all day and the full app on PC is simply better suited for navigation. The mobile side works okay but i expect to be able to use the PC side app when I have it available. Couple this with the fact that I do not want to remove my headphones every time I get a cell phone call and the single pairing option is simply not workable for me. ***I did discover two things after some research. First, supposedly you can pair to two devices, one for audio, and another for hands free calling. However, after following the directions several times on sonys webpage I was never able to get this working. Second, you can pair the headphones to a mobile phone and control the Spotify app via you PC. This made the single pairing option much more manageable for me but is still an inconvenience.\n-Sony MX3 app- Changing any of the audio settings in the app (base/treble/mids) drops the headphones into a lower bandwidth streaming option. I honestly could not tell a huge difference in audio quality when doing this but still found it disturbing\n\n-Sound-\nPROS\n-I found the sound to be relatively accurate and warm, however that is about all I have to say that is nice about it\nCONS\n-Bass heavy- these headphones are really base heavy. This did make the headphones sounds more like a live concert, but I found the base to be muddy and actually drown out the mids and treble with some music I listened to. You are able to turn down the bass in the app but it drops down the quality of your bluetooth connection. On PC I had installed an EQ program and set up a custom profile to tone down the bass. Realistically though this is just extra dicking around that I did not expect with a 350 dollar set of headphones\n\n-Comfort-\nPROS\n-i did like the fact that these hug your head in a more streamlined fashion, eliminating the Micky mouse look present in previous models\n-The cushions on the headband and earcups are very plush and appear that they would hold up to years of daily use\n\nCONS\n-Straight up these are not as comfortable as my Bose soundlink 2s or the QC35 Mark 2s. I do not have overly large earls but still found that parts of my ear touched the inside of earcup. Its not like it was crushing my ears but the slight pressure was definitely there. This may sound like a small gripe, but when you are wearing these headphones for extended periods of time you will most likely find this to be an annoyance. These things also get hot unless you are doing absolutely nothing in a relatively cool environment. If the office was abit warmer than normal or I decided to take a walk around the office I could definitely feel the heat building up. Granted, I am normally not moving when wearing these but if I wanted to wear them while traveling and walking these headphones have a very good chance of making your ears sweat.\n\n-Conclusion-\nAs I said, i really wanted to love these headphones. They are supposedly the latest and greatest, they look good, and have a ton of cool features and upgrades over anything else out there. Unfortunately, after only an hour or two of wearing them I found myself disappointed in them, not something you really want in a 350 dollar purchase. I stuck it out for two weeks and was actively trying to convince myself that these things were as good as everyone was saying they were. I am no music expert but found the sound in these to be very fatiguing and somewhat muddy. While my Bose may sound abit more hollow I have come to enjoy super crisp and punctuated listening across the whole spectrum. Sounds is obviously a very subjective aspect so you may feel differently but I find that my Bose offer a superior listening experience to my ear. The comfort was also a big letdown come from Bose. With my soundlink 2s i would often not even feel them. With the MX3s I definitely felt them and this only exacerbated with extended wear. While not necessarily uncomfortable they simply have a ways to go to dethrone Bose.\nTLDR: For me, everything I found is basically the opposite of 98% of the reviews I read and watched on these headphones. I spent weeks trying to tell myself that I must be missing something that everyone else was seeing but in the end failed to change my views on any aspect of these headphones. For me in the end the Bose QC35IIs simply outperform the MX3s in every aspect that matters to me. I can wear my Bose all day without feeling the need to take them off, the listening experience is more pleasurable to my ear right out of the box (dont have to dick around with any EQ settings), and pairing to multiple devices eliminates the workaround pairing options on the MX3. My advice is to just go with your gut, nobody should have to justify shortcoming in a 350 dollar purchase.",

      "title": "Great for cancelling noise/help you to focus",
      "body": "I did not know what to expect when I put these headphones for the first time and they connected via bluetooth... it was nothing short of amazing. I have the WH1000XM3's (black). It's as if you go straight into a sound chamber and outside noise is drastically reduced. I know you may be saying 'well of course.. that's what noise cancelling means!' However, knowing something and then experiencing it are two different things. To be honest, I think my mind is trying to figure these headphones out still... I get some ringing in my ears and I learned that that can be from the mind compensating for a perceived hearing loss. I think some part of my auditory perception is thinking there is something missing in these environments where I would normally hear a certain degree of noise!\n\nAgain, I risk sounding obvious but you really have to try these to understand what i mean. I have a great workplace to test the efficacy of these headphones out: a coworker in the next cubicle who noisely eats/gulps/drinks/munches and crunches on food and snacks incessantly throughout the day (was driving me nucking futs) and right now we have an A/C issue in the office that requires us to have some kind of industrial swamp cooler contraption as a substitute and it sounds similar to that droning noise that can be heard during air travel from the engines. I know... but I gotta pay the bills!\n\nWhen I put on the WH1000XM3's, both of those noises are substantially reduced which is a godsend to me. Then I add in some low volume classical or dub techno and I am in my own little world! I can focus, relax.. well to the extent that that is possible at work... and the great feature of being able to cup my hand over the right ear cup is fantastic. It seems to not only cut out the noise cancelling so I can hear a legitimate request from my coworkers, but there seems to be a bit of enhancement.. maybe I am just imagining that though.\n\nI have also tested these out and about, walking and such...there are so many opportunities for me to experience noise pollution in the city I live in! I can say that I have finally been able to hear a very soft-spoken pod-caster for the first time without having to increase the volume whenever he spoke during his interviews on his podcasts. Even while walking by noisy traffic/people/construction ....and does anyone else notice the higher volume and pitch of ambulances and other emergency vehicles these days? Those noises were countered very effectively, although some bangs and loud noises seemed to make the noise cancellation compensate a bit too much, still I would rather not hear the offending noises and so the slight interruption to my listening experience during those brief moments is tolerable.\n\nThey also adjust to less noisy environments too: in the early hours of the day, when its almost completely quiet in the environments I'm in at that time, the cancelling drops off and I can hear my car door closing behind me/alarms for forgetting to take the key with me/leaving the headlights on, etc.\n\nThe battery life is also another pleasant surprise. I have doubted manufacturer's claims on battery life, but these really did hold up for close to 30 hours, I have to qualify this by saying that I mostly listen to low-volume classical/techno dub/e-courses/podcasts and the like.\n\nComfort and wearability are quite high. I can stand to have these on for three to four hour stretches at a time and probably go longer if I am on a long flight and desperate to get some sleep. I did try a 45 minute nap with white noise playing and it worked wonderfully. I have tried wearing the headphones upside down, and they hold on just fine, especially helpful for keeping a lower profile at work, not so obviously 'tuning you jerks out.' In the heat of the day, out walking, the ear-cups can feel warm (70-80 degree temps) but not too bad.\n\nOk, now the cons: there were a few glitchy moments with the swiping feature on the right ear-cup and one time where the volume control from the swiping did seem delayed or slow, however I must say that was when I was transitioning from sitting for an extended time at work and then going out for a walk on a break, no excuses, but it was not show stopper, it just took a minute or two for the headphones to 'figure it out.' There was also a moment where I was sure that I was swiping the volume down but the skip track forward feature triggered instead.\n\nOverall though, I would highly recommend these headphones, especially if you were like me and trying to listen to instructional videos/podcasts for any length of time and you need to focus better. I think they are far healthier for my hearing as well: the noise cancelling allows me to play background music at super low volume whereas the in-ear earbuds are just terrible (as I now realize in comparison).",

      "title": "So far so good!",
      "body": "I was in NYC last week on a biz trip and after a few drinks at dinner decided I had to have a pair of ANC headphones.....I walked into Best Buy and picked up the Sony 1000xM2 headphones as id heard great things about them apart from some of the well known build quality issues. I was able to use them for a few hours that night and on my flight home the next day. When I got home I saw in my newsfeed that the M3 was just announced with new features like USB C, new processor, better design etc. I returned the M2 and saw on amazon they already were selling the M3. I was shocked as nowhere else seemed to even have them listed on their site yet for sale. I ordered them assuming it was a mistake and they would not show up. Well, they did show up on time.....:) NIce surprise.\n\nI will say by impressions after using them for a few days compared to the M2:\n\n-WAY better design, more comfy, lighter weight, more padding on top, better larger earcups and overall quality seems better than the M2. The changes are subtle but if you look closely you will see them.\n\n-Battery life is incredible on both M2 and M3 but now with USBC its even a better experience. I literally put them on the charger for like 15 or 20 minutes and they were at 90%. Sony states that a 10 min charge will get 5 hours of playback.\n\n-Sony claims that the noise reduction is 4x better than before. This is where I think I disagree. the M2's had exceptional ANC and these are much the same. You can still hear things going on around you with ANC on and its certainly not 4x better than before. The one area I notice is better is when you cup your hand over the right ear to allow the external microphones to let in noise going on around you, its not as loud and hissy as it was on the M2. IT still lets in the external sound but in a MUCH cleaner way without all the blown out noise around it. Well Done.\n\n-I constantly read on how the M2's and M3's are terrible for use making phone calls. Reviewers mentioned how people complained of echos, terrible mic quality etc,. I was expecting the worst. I called my wife yesterday while she was in her car to try this out for the first time on a call. We spoke for about 20 minutes. She said that my voice was loud and clear and she would not have known I wasn't speaking directly into my phone, but rather the headset. She was in her car which usually would make it even worse so I was nicely surprised. I could hear her well on my end via the M3s so was happy there. I wonder whether this was fixed in these new gen M3s as my call experience was fantastic. My wife usually hates when I call her from a speakerphone etc and often complains that I need to speak into the phone etc so for the M3 to pass her test was pretty incredible.\n\n-I am Happy they finally made a carry case that fits the headphones AND the cables that come with it.....M2 was stupid that only the headphones fit in the case but none of the cords....lol.....really?\n\n-The Sony App is the key here too in that is allows for great customization of the sound on the M3 so i highly recommend using it. THe strange thing is that it supports super high quality sound like LDAC but if you make any change via the app to the EQ settings etc it makes you default to lesser quality codec......weird.....not sure why.\n\n-I have heard some people say they are a bit Bass heavy but really with the app you can tailor however you like. That said i like bass and man these things can put out in a clean way where the bass isnt distracting at all. THese are very clean headphones and the sound to me is better than Bose QC35.......\n\nAll in all, very happy with them and i presume over time Sony will keep pushing updates to them via the app. For instance now they allow Google Assistant and Siri. Ive been using Google assistant on them and its pretty great albeit with a bit of latency to the responses.\n\nLet's not forget how great it is to have touch gestures built into the right earcup too. Man I can't imagine not being able to do this now on every headphone. It's kinda like when your on a buddy's PC and you go to swipe or pinch the screen only to find their PC isn't touchscreen. Lol. Yeah the m3 is that cool. Love using gestures for volume, play, pause, skip, activating Google assistant etc.\n\nAll in all these are a great experience. Hope this helps if you are on the fence.",

      "title": "Significant improvement over the Bose QC35 II",
      "body": "I bought these to replace the Bose QC35 II, which I found to be a major step down from the QC35's. I seem to be alone in this, but the active noise cancelation in the QC35 II actually hurts my ears after less than an hour.\nHowever, I still have my QC35 II and after receiving Sony WH1000XM3, I decided to do some side by side comparison.\n\nOut of the box (default settings):\nSound quality - QC 35II wins, being noticeably less bass heavy.\nNoise canceling - The WH1000XM3 wins hands down. Virtually eliminates all but very loud ambient noise (HVAC, engine noise, fans, etc) and significantly reduces incident noise (finger snaps, voices, tapping, knocks, etc.). I found the QC35 II to be somewhat less effective against ambient noise and almost useless against incident noise. That said, when you are playing music or a video, both headphones eliminate enough sound to make all but the loudest ambient and incident sound negligible.\nApp features - The WH1000XM3 wins hands down again on this. It is far more feature rich than the Bose companion app. The EQ is much more usable, the noise cancellation is adjustable, and the soundstage can be customized to make the source seem to be in one of six different locations. It also has a mode that uses the microphones and some reference tones to adjust the noise cancellation to compensate for your head shape and whether or not you wear glasses, etc. I did notice some difference, but not an overwhelming difference, after applying this feature.\nHeadphone controls - The WH1000XM3 wins hands down again. The buttons on the QC35 II are minimal and not easy to remember if you don't use the headphones often. The WH1000XM3 has only two buttons, which are different sizes to make them easy to differentiate. The rest of the controls are done by a touchpad on the right ear piece. I found this to be extremely intuitive, and was grateful that a single tap on the touchpad does nothing, so it's difficult to accidentally trigger an action.\nOther features: The WH1000XM3 wins again, narrowly. Both headphones have a complete set of features you'd expect on high-end phones in the smartphone era. The WH1000XM3 have one added feature that is nice, but not a must have by any means. If you cup your hand over the right ear piece, the volume of the music/video lowers down to just audible, the noise canceling turns off, and the headphones port outside noise into your ears. This is nice if you're listening and your wife starts talking to you. But at the end of the day, it's only slightly better than taking the headphones partly or completely off.\nComfort: I'll give these a tie. Both are lightweight and ergonomically designed with rotating ear cups. Both have good padding in both headband and ear cup. Any difference between the two will be minimal and totally personal. As I mentioned earlier, I find the noise cancellation in the Bose very uncomfortable after a relatively short time, but this seems to be unique to me, so I wouldn't consider that if you're trying to choose between the two.\nAccessories: This is a complete tie. Both come with the same set of cables (1/8\" cable, airplane two-prong adapter, micro-USB for charging) and both come with very similar flat, semi-rigid travel cases of about the same size, with a stretchy pocket on the outside.\n\nAfter making adjustments:\nThe WH1000XM3 comes out of the box very bass heavy. After making some easy adjustments in the companion app, it's easy to balance them out. Personally, I found that reducing the bass boost to -7, and adjusting the EQ to increase treble frequencies and reduce the lower mids, I got vast improvement. In fact, although it's fairly close and pretty subjective, I found the adjusted sound in the WH1000XM3 to be better than anything I could achieve adjusting the QC35 II. Better balance, more spacious sounding, much clearer bass, less edge in the treble.\n\nThe WH1000XM3's were purchased to replace my QC35 II for travel use (primarily). However, by the time I'd finished getting used to them and making the adjustments to solve the heavy bass, I had really come to love them, and they are have replaced my daily wear cans. About the only thing I won't wear them for now is high-end reference listening where I need absolute fidelity. No bluetooth headset can match good wired reference headphones for that.",

      "title": "Okay but fix the headband issue!!",
      "body": "I have been looking online for really good headphones for awhile and came upon these ones. I got them on Black Friday for $70 off the $349 original pricing. As soon as I tried them I knew that these werent for me. The sound didnt really wow me that much. I usually use a $30 pair of headphones and I expected these to be 10x better than my cheap ones. They are not, in my opinion. I also feel pressure inside my ears whenever I use these headphones. I realize that it's a problem that a few people have with noise cancelling headphones in general. The noise cancelling feature is good btw. But the reason why these headphones get a one star from me is also because I started to get a constant static noise from the right side. Thankfully Im still inside the return window so they'll be going back asap\n\nUPDATE: (Dec 15th, 2019) from 1 to 3 stars.\nI have decided to keep these headphones for a couple of reasons:\nFirst, I was able to fix the static noise on my right cuff by turning the ANC off and then on again. Then I used the EQ to customize the sound, which greatly improved the audio quality. I also got to use these headphones while flying and, holy crap, it masked the whole engine noise of the airplane (although I could still hear every word of the pilot's safety instructions from the plane's speakers which were basically whispers). They were so quiet that it was somewhat a shock to take these off midflight and hear all the noise.\n\nThe reason why I am not giving these headphones more than 3 stars is because I know they still have an issue with cracked headbands which fall under physical damage and therefore cannot be covered by insurance. Again, I used to use $30 headphones (the MPOW ones) and their headbands were built with metal so even after 3.5 years they are still in good shape. Therefore, there is NO reason for these expensive a** headphones to not have at least the same quality as my cheap headphones. I have seen a couple of pics of cracked headphones and many seemed to show that the breaking happened with headphones extended all the way. Thankfully, my head is small and I only use them fully retracted so I'm really hoping that this will help me keep these headphones more safe from damage.\n\n1.3 Year Update:\nNow that I've had these headphones for a bit over 1 year I can make a better review based on my experience. I bumped the rating from 1 star to 4 stars because of a few things. First of all, the loud static noise completely went away by itself after 3 months of use. I went from hearing it constantly when turning on the headset to hearing nothing at all. Kinda strange...but I'm happy about it. In addition, with the lockdown I have been home pretty much everyday so I have used this headset pretty much continuously for the past year. I wake up, put these headphones on and get on with my day until my day is over. I fall asleep in bed wearing these almost every night. Sometimes I take them off right before falling asleep but these boys have seen a fair share of abuse when I fall asleep, forget to take them off and roll around in bed. There isn't a single crack on them, which was something that I was really worried about since these headphones have a common quality issue where they crack on the parts that you can extend. It's worrying since this is usually something that happens after the 1month return period ends and Sony won't fix them since they don't consider it to be a manufacturing issue (it totally is). However, some of the reviews that I read about the cracking issue was from people who fold these headphones, which is something that I don't do since I just use them at home. So, from my personal experience, the headset has been very durable. (I have to note that I am a small person so I don't extend the headset at all, which might contribute to the reason why my headphones haven't cracked, idk)\nAlso, I just purchased a new set of replacement earpads here on Amazon just now because after 1 year or so, the foam loses some of its shape, worsening the noise cancellation. I depend on the noise cancellation feature, it's my favorite thing about these headphones so replacing the earpads is something that I just had to do. The original earpads are still extremely comfy tho. Some of the earpads on Amazon cost from $14-$18. The ones I got were $18, I believe.",

      "title": "Pretty Good, but not quite the “perfect”/”best” headphones many declare them to be.",
      "body": "Pros: I’ll open this by saying that these are hands down the best sounding pair of headphones I’ve ever owned. I have about 20-30 hours of use and have yet to experience a single BT signal drop. The noise cancelling feature is pretty great. So why not five stars?\n\nCons\n1. The voice mic doesn’t really function for what I need it for (and how I think it should).\n2. App/connectivity issues.\n3. Probably not useful in some environments.\n\nDetails\nOne. I bought these primarily as a replacement for my wired computer headset I use on my desktop / laptop, thinking they would at least replace my wired/mic’d headset. Unfortunately, there is literally no functionality to be used as a mic’d headset with these. I figured since they can be used as a talk/listen device for calls on a mobile phone, they would function as such on a computer or phone apps. Nope. Don’t fall for it. Move on right now if that’s a thing you’re looking to do. It does state in the manual that these cannot be used with other voice apps on a phone (so don’t expect that either), but my desktop / laptop doesn’t even recognize there is a mic option with these headphones. No connecting to or using it Google Voice/HOuts, or any other VOIP app/recorder, either on the phone or desktop. This is a big flaw, and something people should be fully aware of IMO. It would have been enough for me to not buy these. I’ll be hoping Sony fixes this in a future app/FW update.\n\nTwo. There is no Windows (and presumably Mac) app at all for connectivity and settings (iOS and Android only). Windows BT recognizes these as a regular pair of headphones just fine, but you will not be able to adjust *any* internal settings unless you do it from the phone app.\n\nBT battery reporting on the phone app initially did not work and said I had 0% battery, despite the headphones vocal prompt telling me they were fully charged 100% and being able to make all other adjustments in the app (fully connected and functional otherwise). For a bit of back and forth and power ups and downs or both phone and headphones, I got pretty frustrated and was ready to return them for a faulty battery as the app won’t even update the phone firmware if the problem was these because the battery is “too low” and since there’s no way to do it through Windows (USB cable or BT) I was on the verge of packing these up to return. Fortunately, in a last ditch effort, I disconnected and told my phone to “forget” the BT device and when I reconnected the BT device, and was able to finally update. Unfortunately, again, when the headphone FW updated it happened again despite everything else about the app settings functioning perfectly again (clearly a bug Sony hasn’t fixed yet). So I had to do a disconnect and forget and reconnect all over again. There’s really no excuse for the app not knowing the battery level when the actual headphones do.\n\nAnother aside too, it would be really nice if these has some kind of “disengage” option, at least for a time, to the touch volume and playback buttons on the right headphone even if only in the app. While it’s nice and handy and works well, I’ve also accidental paused and or advanced or changed the volume of these several times already just brushing it while trying to adjust the comfort on the physical headset. I don't see ever being able to sleep with these on.\n\nThree. Although I knew what I was getting with this style of headphones so I don’t consider it a flaw, so far I’ve only used these in an environment of 70 degrees or less. They will likely be too warm to wear in in non-AC summer setting and I can see getting limited use in the summer months, which wouldn’t bother me much if these also didn’t have a low point operational temp of 32F/0C. While they’ll probably be fine for a brief period in lower temps, in Chicago it spends about 4 months below these temps, I don’t expect using them as makeshift earmuffs in 12 degrees at the L/bus stop is going to always work either.\n\nAgain, most of this is not enough to make me regret the purchase or return them, but I’d wish I’d known about a couple before buying. Hope this review may save one or two of you some frustrations.",

      "title": "Phenomenal upgrade from wired headphones for SmartTV w/Bluetooth",
      "body": "After decades of using wired Sony MDR-V6 headphones as my go-to pair for watching TV at night when not wanting to disturb others, and upon realizing \"wait a sec, my LG OLED TV supports bluetooth audio output?\"—I decided I wanted to treat myself to a Black Friday pair of these highly-rated Sony WH1000 XM3 headphones.\n\nPros:\n- Very good noise cancellation\n- The ambient sound function is also pretty nice and works well; I especially like how you can activated it by the switch or by temporarily holding your hand over the right can's touch controls\n- Comfortable to wear for long periods of time\n- No noticeable audio lag between my TV and the sound in my ears\n- Nice being able to just sweep up or down on the right side ear-can to increase or decrease the volume\n- Excellent battery life and relatively fast charging\n- USB-C charging port, so no more \"which side goes up\" nonsense\n- You can plug audio into these headphones with a standard 1/8\" cable, which is provided, although it's not very long\n- A 2-prong aircraft audio adapter is also provided\n- WIRELESS, baby!\n\nNeutral:\n- Sound almost but not quite up there with the MDR-V6s I've been used to, which to my ear have a warmer sound.\n- The standard 'pleather'-style pads are reasonably soft and comfortable, but do generate a little bit of heat after hours of listening\n- The case is pretty nice, but really only useful if you do a lot of traveling with these; for me, the headphones sit on a little stand I already owned, next to my TV watching recliner\n- A phone app (available on Google Play or Apple store) is needed to manage the headphone at the detailed level, although once you've set it to your liking, you don't necessarily need it very often\n- Have to learn not to accidentally touch the touch controls, especially when putting on or removing the headphones\n\nCons:\n- Their provided USB-C charging cable is comically short. You will need a longer one. Trust me on this. Buy yourself a USB 3.0 standard-to-USB-C cable, unless you already have a spare.\n- You will also need a USB charger because they don't provide one.\n- I noticed one night that after I finished watching TV and disconnected bluetooth, the headphones reverted to a connection with my Android phone, which then caused both the headphones and phone to run their batteries down over the next 12-16 hours. Led to my surprise when the headphones the following night said they had no charge and shut down. Not sure if this is intentional behavior or not, but I've made sure not to let my phone reconnect by default since I got these headphones almost exclusively for the TV.\n- There technically *is* multi-pairing capability, but it's kind of clumsy and you have to manually disconnect/reconnect to switch between connected bluetooth devices. (I have not yet tried to connect simultaneously between the TV and the phone, but the instructions indicate it may be possible.)\n- I'd also say that there should be some other way to use Alexa or Google voice assistant services without having to override the sound canceling / ambient sound button's functions. Maybe there is, but the guides and manuals all say that in order to use voice assistant features, you have to give up that button.\n\nOne thing I did do was to separately purchase a replacement set of suede ear pads from Dekoni Audio (available here on Amazon also). They were a tad pricey, and you do give up a little noise canceling isolation, but they're much more comfortable and weren't very difficult to install.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed with these headphones, and gaining both sound canceling and wireless capabilities have made me glad I bought them. It's nice no longer being tethered to the A/V receiver. Sound is good, battery life excellent, synchronization is pretty solid, and I've had no particular issues with bluetooth connectivity. Would buy again, but I do feel that Sony has some room for improvement on controls and UI. And it would be even better if I could truly connect to multiple devices at once, such as phone + TV at the same time, with full functionality.",

      "title": "Beat the Bose, but only barely!",
      "body": "I bought both these and the Bose QuietComfort 35 ii headphones to test. If you’re deciding between the two, here’s a few of my thoughts and why I ultimately went with the Sony headphones:\n\nBose Pros:\n- Absolutely incredible sound quality for anything vocals-related or for classical/acoustic instruments. If you listen to predominately classical, opera, jazz, or acoustic music, stop reading here and get the Bose.\n- Slightly better sound cancellation in office-type environments or when you’re trying to drown out conversation.\n- Slightly lighter, which is worth considering if you have neck problems.\n- More comfortable fit. I barely noticed that I was wearing these and the fit was almost perfect.\n\nBose Cons:\n- Weak bass. And I mean WEAK. Audiophiles will talk about how “true sound quality” generally has less pronounced bass, and that may be absolutely true, but when I listen to rock or EMD I like my earlobes to vibrate a little. These did not deliver there.\n- Inability to change the equalizer. Bose claims to automatically adjust the equalizer based on what is being played, but that often leads to the lack of bass issue described above. Everyone has different listening preferences and being able to adjust what you hear can be huge.\n- Suede-type headband material. I have extremely curly hair and use a lot of hair product to keep it from being an explosion of frizz. I needed something that can be easily wiped down and cleaned.\n\nSony Pros:\n- Better overall sound balance. They have never made me feel like I’m standing in the middle of an orchestra like the Bose did for classical pieces, but I listen to every genre under the sun and needed something that could perform for all music and not just shine for a minority of pieces and be lackluster for the rest.\n- Ability to change the equalizer\n- Ability to temporarily pause the noise cancelling by touching the right ear cup to listen to outside noise. This was a huge help when traveling.\n- Better noise cancellation for traveling/commuting noise. These are fantastic when on the train or when flying- flying especially, since you can optimize the noise cancellation based on atmospheric pressure and background noise. I sat a few seats away from a screaming baby and barely heard anything.\n- Better packaging. The case has a strip of soft material running through the middle to keep your headphone cups from scratching against each other and designated pockets for charging cords. The Bose does not.\n- Touch capabilities if that’s something you use/care about. I generally control music using my phone regardless, so it doesn’t matter much to me.\n- Quickcharge ability. Plugging these in for 10 minutes when the battery is low will give you 5 hours or so of listening time.\n\nSony Cons:\n- Slightly heavier and fit a little tighter. They’re a bit more uncomfortable to wear if you wear earrings or glasses. I almost always have to take earrings out when I work with them on, which can be annoying.\n- Sound quality may be more balanced, but it doesn’t shine in any particular areas.\n\nOverall I thought the Bose fit better and had better sound quality for vocal/classical pieces, but almost every other genre lacked an enjoyable bass. I also had concerns with keeping the material clean. I ultimately went with the Sonys because they were more balanced overall. I valued sound over all other characteristics, but your own mileage may vary. As a note, I also use an iPhone so I was less concerned with the audio file capabilities. It was a very tight race that was won by millimeters, so I do recommend trying both if you have the opportunity before making a decision.",

      "title": "Are they really worth the upgrade?",
      "body": "So preordered these because I figured I'd break them in for awhile before posting. Then compare them side by side to the WH1000xm2. I will list the advantage this has over the m2 then finding out if you need to upgrade to help with your purchase decision. I use the Sony pretty religiously so no nitpicking here.\n\n1. Sound quality: The Wh1000xm3 sound better than the wh1000xm2 for obvious reason but not blow out the water better. You hear more separation in your music. Also if you ever use the surround modes (dont hate me for this mx2 owners) but there is a very faint but slightly annoying static that occurs when you use the surround modes. Especially on arena mode. The wh1000xm3 erased this totally and that static is no longer there. This may be a big reason of Sony adding the QN1 chip as the wh1000xm2 may have tried to process the music and noise cancelling but since there was no medium, both went throughthe same channels which causes static that you hear. It made my listening experience far more enjoyable.\n\n2. Noise cancelling: Noise cancelling is not noise proof. It does block out more sound than its predecessor however with noise cancelling I felt that the m2 cancelled more sound. Although with noise cancelling on, the m3 do a much better job. I no longer had to put music up to 50 percent to block out sound from very moist environments. Just 20-25 does the trick. Although by itself it already cancels noise out exceptionally better.\nNow to clarify the reason the reason why noise cancelling headphones have a hard time cancelling voices. It's really because your voice is not a constant sound wave. It constantly oscillates and to produce counter sound waves to that requires a lot. Despite this, these are the best noise cancelling headphones on the market right now. Now are they 4x better in noise cancelling? I would say 40%better but not 4x which seems like a stretch. But getting rid of the static may have been something.\n\nBuild quality: To cut down on costs since you already have the QN1 chip and for a smoother design. Sony added the plastic over the brush aluminum. Also to appeal to their female market as well, they tried to make headphones that appealedto both genders. If you notice, not many girls really wanted to try the wh1000xm2. I did a test of and I got a positive response for men about wearing the wh1000xm2 about 82% while only 18%of females really wanted to try the wh1000xm2. However for the xm3 with the same even 100 amount. I got a higher positive response from females about 42% to 56% men. Plus the lighter xm3 adds to longer hours of listening. The wh1000xm3 is still built well, although you had a leather cup to create a better noise cancelling seal. The wh1000xm3 does not need that so it can afford a sleek appearance. Plus it cuts down on the weight. There is added padding at the top of the wh1000xm3 so when you bump your head, you are protected from most of the shock whereas with the m2 they get scratched at the top fairly easily.\n\nUSB: USB-C instead of micro is a vast improvement. Do keep in mind your charger is also a prominent factor on how well it stays. I recommend using anker products for their cables and wall charger. The Sony cable is pretty short. The audio cable us really not THAT bad and it seems most people are overreacting about this and I'm not sure why.\n\nCase: the case is definitely sturdier and has more room inside. Although I do miss the snap on and snap off case of the m2.\n\nWhat I pointed out where key points as most other things can be looked up on the Sony page and reading the features of the headphones. Although please note neither have multipoint connecting abilities. Although this never bothered as my phone my main source so that's never bothered me.\n\nBut is it worth the upgrade? If it really isnt in your budget, I would sell your XM2 first then get the XM3. If the xm2 has been working well for you then you are fine. Save yourself another $350. If it is in your budget just measure against other items you could get, if this is it, go for it. I can say you will not be disappointed.",

I am a music lover (lots of melodic death metal and just all metal in general) and these make me happy on a daily basis. I wear them Monday-Friday about 4 hours a day cleaning houses.\n\nPros: everything is easy to use and actually works when you want it to. To have a piece of electronic equipment not have A SINGLE ISSUE in over 3 years is unheard of. The sound quality is amazing. I can hear every piece of the drum kit clearly and all the notes from the guitar. I also use the noise canceling option on planes and when annoying people are near me. The Bluetooth is a breeze everytime and I haven't had any audio drop outs or calls dropped. Solid headset if you want to rock out to some metal or chill out to chill beats. It has to be the best headset in this price range and durability is unparalleled. I love that the button on the left ear tells you how much battery life is left. I haven't had these lose charge or cabalitiy to charge. It is insane the quality. I have been getting lower quality things for so long that these really made a good impression.\n\nCons: bulky and headphone ear piece foam absorbs sweat. I usually plug the headset in to charge with the cups up to dry. Not even worth calling an inconvenience unless you take a shower and then need to use them. I like being clean so it bugs me.\n\nI didn't get paid to right this or anything. I am simply a very pleased customer!",

      "title": "Surprised I can use it with gas-powered yard equipment",
      "body": "I bought these headphones to have a top-notch set of Bluetooth headphones. I wanted good sound for classical music. I use it an noisy office environment (lots of people on conference calls). My expectations for the active noise cancellation (ANC) was relatively low. I have an early set of wired ANC headphones and they are okay and I didn't expect much improvement. I was pleasantly surprised. Here are my observations:\n1. In the office environment, almost all voice and computer equipment were cancelled out. If I listen carefully, I might hear my cubical neighbor as though his is in a quiet room, far, far away. With quiet classical music, I can't hear him at all.\n2. I tired these headphones with my gas powered lawn mower. While I heard the lawn mower over the headphones, it was like it was several houses away in my neighborhood. I could play podcasts on low volume. I was very pleasantly surprised about this.\n3. I can hear wind against my headphones. It doesn't prevent me from listening to podcasts, but I was surprised by the amount of wind sound given the headphone performance in other areas.\n4. In default mode, the headphones does a good job of adjusting the noise cancellation in my environment. In the office, it did maximum mode. When walking outside, it adjusted so I could hear traffic (important, I was walking on a street without sidewalks). The only issue on automatic adjustment was mowing the lawn. I had to manually set it to maximum noise cancellation.\n5. I love that I can cup the right headphone to hear someone talk to me. My only issue is that it turns the volume down instead of pausing the audio. Since I listen to a lot of podcasts, pausing would be a nice feature.\n6. While the over-the-ear headphones are very comfortable, my ears are irritated after wearing for 90+ minutes. I have never found headphones that prevented this with my large ears -- but these are the most comfortable I ever tried.\n7. The touch controls on the right headphone are okay. It is taking me a while to get used to them, especially the center pause area I find very tricky. I think in a few weeks they will become second nature to me, but it is taking a while.\n8. I like the compact carrying case and how the headphones fold-up in it. Nice.\n9. I like the wire earphone jack that comes with it. It goes into my PC and bypasses Bluetooth.\n10. The phone microphone is only okay. It picks up the ambient noise around me more than like in phone conversations. In Skype calls, I have to be careful to mute my microphone when I am not talking, much more so than my cheap headphones. If I am in a shopping mall, it picks up a lots of the noise around me. Outside phone conversations in windy conditions are nearly impossible.\n11. These headphones are not for all circumstances. I will not use them driving. I will not use them in sweaty exercise or workouts. I use AfterShotz Trekz Air in those situations, they don't block my ears and are sweat-proof.\n12. I love the 30-hour battery life! -- and with quick charge feature.\n\nOverall, I think these are the best for this kind of headphones on the market. They are expensive, and they are not for every situation. I believe that having several different kinds of headphones for the different situations and environments I'm in. Also, I have purchased through Amazon the 3 year extended warranty -- I have had enough problems with headphones in the past where this is useful. I would not purchase the extended warranty from Best Buy -- it is too expensive now. I think part of the problem is that too many people turn-in their headphones just before the warranty runs out to get the latest headphones. Unless there is a genuine problem with the headphones, I don't think that is ethically right to do.",

      "title": "Excellent audio, bad mic, uncomfortable",
      "body": "Recap: At first, I purchased Bose QC35ii but found that at low volume the music was drowned out by static. Digging into it, I realized that Bose only supports one quality bluetooth codec -- AAC -- and skips high quality codecs such as AptX HD and LDAC. So, I went ahead and tried out two pairs of headphones that support these advanced codecs: Sony WH1000XM3 and Shure Aonic 50. I found that the sound of the Sony and Shure is more detailed and less sculpted, but their mics were noisy and their comfort was lacking compared to QC35ii. In the end, I found that Bose QC35ii was the most reasonable compromise to comfort, sound quality, and mic quality. I can wear Bose QC35ii all day and not feel any discomfort. With Sony, I develop a headache after a couple of hours if I don't move the headband that presses into my head. Shure is more comfortable than Sony, but both Shure and Sony press on the ears (might not be a problem for you if you don't have big ears; I do). Here is the summary of pros and cons, followed by details:\n\nPros:\n\n- Excellent selection of high-quality codecs: AAC, aptX HD, LDAC\n- Best stability of LDAC connection\n- Long battery life: well above 20 hours, whereas both Shure and Bose max out around 20 hours.\n- Excellent active noise cancellation\n\nCons:\n\n- Really, really uncomfortable after a couple of hours\n- Mic picks up low-frequency noise, and my voice breaks several times a minute\n\nDetails:\n\nSound and stability: XM3 provides the best sound quality and connection reliability to my Pixel XL. The connection quality using the highest-quality LDAC protocol is extremely reliable (in comparison, when using LDAC Aonic 50 would stutter often; QC35ii does not support LDAC). Android App allows to switch between prioritizing sound or connection quality when using LDAC codec (useful, because at the lowest quality, LDAC is worse than SBC or AAC). On Shure, this is something you have to do through developer settings. The highest-quality setting causes Shure's LDAC connection to break up. However, Shure performed well when using aptX HD, which I could not tell from LDAC (admittedly, I did not test this on uncompressed music). I still found that the sound quality is better with Shure 50, as they give you more texture of the sound (you can separate out individual instruments more easily).\n\nNoise cancelling: Instead of allowing you to control the strength of ANC like Bose (High/Low setting), Sony allows you to choose on the scale from 1 to 10 how much external sound gets rebroadcast to the inside of the headphones. You have the option to have the headphones to \"focus on voice\", my favorite option because it discards outside noise yet still allows me to aware if someone is calling for me around the house. This is also the option I use when I am on the calls: this way I can hear my own voice, which helps me not to shout into the phone. It turns out it is really hard to compare the strength of noise cancelling between the headphones. All of them are impressive. Bose's ANC comes along with quite a bit of white noise, Sony's and Schure's is more seamless.\n\nMicrophone: Sony's mic is a weak spot: not only does it pick up low-frequency noise (e.g., A/C hum), but it also causes my voice to break (it is not dramatic but happens several times a minute). The mic on Shure was particularly atrocious, recording an electric hum even in a completely quiet room. Bose mic came out on top.\n\nComfort: The dealbreaker for me was that Sony's headband pushed on the top of my head so hard that I developed a headache after a 2-3 hours. I ended up returning the headphones and kept Bose QC35ii, which -- with all of their drawbacks -- offered unparalleled comfort and high-quality microphone for all day Zoom sessions.",

      "title": "Best purchase (of my life? maybe?)",
      "body": "If you're looking for a reason to shell out for these headphones, here is your sign.\nI have had these headphones for almost two years, and I am deeply in love with them. I purchased them to use in graduate school for studying, and I cannot think of anything else I could've bought that would have helped me more.\n\nThe noise cancellation is awesome. Of course, nothing is perfect, and it can't completely silence voices, but it muffles voice and background noise plenty enough to help a great deal with focus, with going to sleep, whatever. On a regular basis, people will have to come wave their hand in my face because I can't hear them calling for me with these on. It's nice to be able to adjust the level of noise cancellation, too. With a button on one ear, you can go from non-noise cancelling, to your own custom noise-cancelling setting, to full noise-cancelling.\n\nThe battery life is amazing. I use these headphones for anywhere from 4 to 10 hours a day, and they still can go for at least 2 days without needing to be recharged, and that's after 2 years of HEAVY use. If they're dying, but I'm still wanting to use them, I charge them for just a few minutes and you can get another hour/multiple hours out of them. Insane. The charger is the same shape as the classic updated Android charger, so can just charge them with my phone charger (not a microUSB, idk what it's called).\n\nSound quality wasn't my primary concern when I bought them, but I still think its awesome.\n\nThe swiping features on the one side for skipping forward/back and changing volume are great. Got used to them very quickly and they work well. It is pretty sensitive, and can sometimes I accidentally hit something I didn't want to, but it's a minor annoyance.\n\nWhat did take some getting used to for the first time noise-cancelling user was the slight pressurized feeling. It feels a tiny bit like you're in an airplane, but I adjusted really quickly.\n\nThe padding is super comfortable, I fall asleep in them often. Not gonna lie, they definitely smell gross, but I'm sure that's going to happen with any padded headphones. They are fairly easy to remove/wash/replace, but I did have to look up how to take them off on YouTube. Just be gentle.\n\nI am not the most gentle with my possessions, so they've taken quite a few spills and have no functional issues to speak of. They don't scuff easily at all, and still look almost pristine. I have the beige-gray color, and I really like it.\n\nIf this pair ever dies on me, I have no doubt in my mind that I would just replace them with the same thing. If you're moving in with roommates and you like things quiet, this is the purchase to make to prevent a lot of fights with them. Honestly, I could talk about them all day. Save yourself stress and get these.",

      "title": "Surpasses BOSE in both noise cancelling and audio quality",
      "body": "Bluetooth audio has come a long way since the olden days. With new codec technologies like aptx and ldac, audio transmission over Bluetooth is slowly reaching fidelity levels that are comparable to that of a wired connection. That's of course taking into consideration the source and quality of amplification on wired setups. But considering the fact that the trade off in having no cables comes at a sacrifice in sound quality, these Sony's do make that sacrifice a very small and one that is worthwhile.\n\nTraveling with studio gear meant that I have to drown nosies by cranking up the volume which is not a good solution long term as it can potentially damage your hearing. One could argue that IEMs tend to solve that problem and that is true for those that are able to wear them comfortably for long periods of time. Unfortunately that had never been the case for me. My ear canals are rather small and I can only wear the smallest IEMs for less than an hour before itching and irritation occurs. Having custom IEMs built meant I would spend over $1000 for something worthwhile so I ditched them and moved on to cans early down the road.\n\nI owned a pair of Bose quiet comforts for 5+ years and for the longest time they were my only option for noise cancelling. The only other option was the PXC550s that came down the road. I always knew that by taking my Bose with me it meant that I sacrifice sound quality for the sake of noise cancelling as my quiet comforts simply were no match to anything else studio level I listened to such as HD6xx, HD800s (granted both are open back) and the Fostex TH-X00's which are closed backs. I started shopping for an alternative and just as I was getting ready to pull the trigger on the PXC550s I saw the announcement that Sony was planning to release the XM3s. I had shyed away from the XM2s due to the scares of build quality and lack of USB-C support, the same reason I was reluctant to get the PXC500s. I decided to take a chance and get these and honestly I couldn't be any happier.\n\nThese headphones do two things very well. One is I find their noise cancelling ability much better than BOSE's. There's an odd feeling with BOSE that I don't get with the XM3s almost like a vacuum sensation. The second is their audio quality is not even comparable to the QCs by BOSE. BOSE's QC2.5 has a very muffled sound. Highs are very subdued, mids are grainy and lows are weak. The XM3s on the other hand provide a balanced but rather veiled sound. I find them a lot more enjoyable to listen to for long periods of time. Mids come off as a bit receded, highs are clear and lows are more refined. No these are not a bassheads dream but they hold their own fairly well for what they are aimed at. They are no match for the soundstage of something like the HD6xx or HD800s but those headphones also aren't closed back or noise cancelling so you are making a huge trade off. The strong noise cancelling more than makes up for that in my opinion. One key note for anyone considering getting these is that you want to be running Android 8.0 with LDAC support. I don't own any Apple devices so I can't speak to that as far as compatibility. But in order to get the most out of the sound codec you want to be running 32bit ~900k 96khz LDAC streaming over Bluetooth.\n\nIf you're in the market for Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones that utilize USB-C, these should be an insta-buy. You won't regret the premium investment.",

The only down side I would say these headphones have is that the mic quality is sub par in comparisson to similar or cheaper headphones.

It is also not the most pleasant one to use since the double tapping on the earpiece feels like \"BOOM-BOOM\" inside the earpiece.\n\nCall quality / microphone - something I was afraid of in light of a number of reviews that came up on YouTube/Amazon.\nI spoke to two people without saying I was using a special headset.\nthey did not complain about the call quality.\nAt the end of the call I asked if I sounded bad. the person on the other end said that I sounded fine and they didn't even hear the television that was working on a normal volume in the background.\nI do not know the comparison point of bad reviews regarding the mic on the M3.\nI'll keep track of whether there will be a change in upcoming calls I made using the M3's.\nRelative to QC35 I can say that on my side of the calls I didn't feel a difference.\n\nVideo / Game Consumption - Watching videos from YouTube / Netflix a minor delay, non-issue. Action movie trailers feel just like in the movies (with deep bass). The delay on gaming was more noticeable a 1ms in rough estimation.",

      "title": "Chose the Sony WH-1000XM3 over the Bose QC35 MII",
      "body": "Similar to many reviews I also experienced the strange ear pressure from the ANC function on the Bose QC 35 M II (which concerned me). It was never painful, but at first a bit annoying. Also like many other reviews, after using them for about a week it seemed to be less apparent less often. I would probably have been fine keeping Bose QC 35 M II (maybe) - they were a gift and are quite nice. However, I decided to try the Sony's in order to make a more informed choice.\n\n1) I found the Sony's to be a bit less comfortable around and on the ear, because the cushions are not as thick as the Bose and the foam of the inner part of headphone rests on your ears. The Bose by contrast had thick pads that held the inner part of the earphones completely off your ear. I would compare it to wearing a cozy pair of slippers (Sony's), v.s. a light-weight loose fitting soft cotton shirt (Bose). I preferred the Bose on this point.\n2) I did find the clamping pressure of the Sony's to be a bit too much, and preferred the Bose for comfort on this level as well.\n3) I also liked that the Bose had an on/off switch where as the Sony had a button that did not physically change position based on whether the unit was on or off. The Sony swipe controls may also take a little more getting used to but in the end may be more convenient.\n4) On the ANC, I found the noise cancelling on the Sony's to be superior. I work in an office with very loud ventilation and the Sony's were noticeably quieter (confirmed by a co-worker). I haven't tried them on a plane yet, but I'm going to assume they will be better there as well - and if not they should be plenty adequate. With the Sony's I did notice some initial moments where there was a higher pitch background noise that would come on and off a few times, then it went away - perhaps the system needed a little time to get straightened out. I also did not notice the pressure on the eardrums that I observed with the Bose.\n5) I'm not an audiophile, so they both sounded good to me. Perhaps the Sony's were better, as I did feel a little bit more immersed in what I would describe as a richer sound with the Sony's.\n\nIn summary, Bose were more comfortable on the ear surface and on the head. Sony's had better noise cancelling, and did not create the pressure on the eardrum that I experienced with the Bose. Sound I tip my hat to Sony. Both very nice, and if you have a ton of money, or fly A LOT, or someone gifts them to you, (and you are ok with the eardrum pressure of the Bose) then you will likely be happy with either.\n\nUpdate: 5/3/2019 - Still happy with my decision to go with the Sony's over the Bose, but the Bluetooth connectivity is annoying. The Bose allowed you to be simultaneously connected to more than one device over Bluetooth. The Sony's do not, and furthermore to get the Sony's to pair with a new device, you have to physically turn the Bluetooth on the currently connect device off. Bose is definitely superior on the ease of Bluetooth connectivity. I would imagine Sony's issues can be solved with firmware, as opposed to requiring different hardware (I could be wrong). If that is the case, Sony needs to pay attention to this and step their game up. In my opinion this improvement would put them clearly in the lead against Bose in the wireless ANC headphones race.",

      "title": "Great sound and awesome features!!!",
      "body": "Ok first off, my first pair of newer over ear headphones were the Soul by Ludaris as I went to Bestbuy and listened to the Beats, Soul, soul Republic, Bose, etc etc, and picked the Soul by Ludacris because to my ears they sounded the best. (These were wired)\n\nMy son had a pair of the over ear Beats which also sounded good but not as good as the Soul did (also wired)\n\nI was in an airport a few months back and bought the Bose QC35 II's, and they were very nice but didn't go as loud as I would have liked them too. I gave them to my wife and trusted CNET and other reviews stating Sony had outdone themselves on the Gen 3 of these headphones.\n\nFirst, I do not wear them everyday, I take them when I am traveling and randomly use them if I need to tune everything out to get work done. The noise canceling on these is amazing. My keyboard clicks very loudly and with these on I cannot hear it at all. They have 3 settings, noise canceling, ambient, and no ambient. The noise canceling is truly the best I have ever tried from the Soul's to the Beats to the QC35 II's. Handsdown amazing noise canceling. As for the ambient setting, it is nice as is slightly amplifies the ambient noise around you so you can hear without the headphone muffling the noise. And when they are in no ambient the software isn't running and they act like standard over ear headphones that would somewhat muffle sound.\n\nThe features are quite cool. I read in someone's review that when outside in the cold the touch interface has issues, but I am not wearing them out in the cold so that is not something that would affect the performance for my usage. The right ear exterior is the touch interface with simple intuitive gestures to make it play, pause, volume up or down, skip tracks forward and backward, and my favorite feature hold your hand over the right ear and they recognize that you need to speak with someone and they switch from active noise canceling to the ambient boost setting so you can talk without shouting or taking them off. Quite ingenious when you think about it, especially if you use them frequently on planes.\n\nAll in all, I own playstations (3 and 4) but have rather thought of Sony as an afterthought when it comes to high level electronics in today's market. However, these headphones earn their top choice editor's pick status hands down. I trust a lot of the reviews on CNET and other reputable tech sites, and can say that if you are looking for a great pair of bluetooth over ear noise canceling headphones, then look at these, as I think they are the best. I have an iPhone XS and they paired quickly and the Sony app allows you to actively adjust the sound without using the Apple EQ which is nice since a lot of the reviews state they are too bass heavy, a quick adjustment fixes that. They also come with a nice case very similar to the one my Bose QC35 II's came in, but seems slightly thinner, which is nice.\n\nI listen to a lot of different music from hip hop to punk rock and most things in between and they sound great with everything I have tried them with. I don't think you will go wrong with these if this is the type and style of headphone you are looking for.",

At least it doesn't time out and power-down after 10 minutes like the Bose 700 (another brain-dead feature IMHO).\n- noise cancellation is more effective on lows than highs, some highs bleed through, but not much. Contrast that with the lower end Bose QC models (I own a QC-25) where the opposite is true, lows bleed through un challenged, but they squelch the highs perfectly. The Bose ear-buds are the only model that stops all sound, but they have the Darth Vader breathing effect since they are air-tight with the your ear canals. You just can't win entirely with any of these yet, and I have bought so many of them, searching for the perfect daytime and sleeping aid.\n- no way to lock the touch sensitive controls, so forget trying to sleep on a pillow with these on,, unless you can not sleep on your right side, yes I wanted to do this and would permanently attach these to my head.\n\nNow for the deets:\n\nI found someone who measured these and gave a frequency response curve. Downloaded EqualizerAPO for windows and compensated. When compensated to flat they approach studio-grade cans. I prefer a bass boost however and put back most (but not all), of the factory bass boost.\n\nTo summarize, the factory setting amounts to a shelving EQ of +5 db at 250 hz. And another additional shelving EQ boost of 3db at 40hz. It was the 40hz one that I didn't like, I didn't need that much low thump kicking me in the ears all the time. I also reduced the boost to about +4 db shelving at 250 hz, and now it sounds like a dream. A simple high pass at 40Hz also did the trick for me, although some may want that lower material, you know who you are... :-)\n\nAs a pair of phones that I never take off, now that I am working from home, the switchable noise cancellation is a fantastic feature, here are it's modes described with my opinions about them:\n- in full noise cancellation mode it filters out most ambient noise, lets a little treble through, but not much.\n- in external sound mode, the mic actually pics up ambient sound and carries it through, works like a hearing aid, but with much better sound quality. If it had an on-board programmable EQ and a compressor it could outshine a lot of hearing aids out there.\n- external sound off, here it is just a passive headphone without NC, some noise bleeds through, but it isn't amped like in the previous mode, nice to have when you want to hear some but not all of what is going on around you.",

      "title": "Easily best in class. Detailed review.",
      "body": "These headphones are a perfect example of how Japan completely shames China. I've tried three of the \"top rated\" Chinese over the ear noise canceling headphones and they don't even come close to these in terms of sound quality, noise canceling, or build quality. I've tried the best rated models from Cowin, Taotronics, and Mpow all recently created Chinese brands that likely won't exist in another few years.\n\nGranted these cost more that the Chinese brands but the Sony headphones don't cost more than the premium equivalent Bose or Beats yet they outperform the best Bose and Beats have to offer in terms of sound quality and noise canceling. Bose and Beats both spend most of their money on marketing and not enough on product design. Sony sweats the engineering details and it shows.\n\nFirst off you don't need the Sony iOS or Android app to use these despite the start up instructions implying otherwise. They pair perfectly right out of the box and the active noise reduction is on by default. The swipe gestures on the earcups also work by default without an app. Yeah the app adds more features like adjustable noise reduction, EQ options, etc, but you don't need it. The user interface is well done all the way around.\n\nEverything about these headphones is premium. They're lightweight yet feel really well made. They're very comfortable with nice large ear cups to actually fit over your ears instead of crushing your ears like many others. The case is also very nice and the ear cups lay flat so the ear pads don't get mangled like they do on so many Chinese headphones.\n\nEven the voice prompts sound premium compared to the crude prompts from Chinese headphones. There's even a bit of reverb in the voice to make it more realistic.\n\nBut, by far, the best part of these headphones is the amazing noise canceling. While the best Chinese brands do OK with low frequency constant noise like say an air conditioner the Sony headphones remove FAR more ambient noise over a much wider frequency range. It's honestly almost surreal. You put them on and it's like you've been immersed into a magic black hole. Even the big bulky head clamping hearing protectors like you use with power tools don't provide this much isolation.\n\nThe second best part is the sound quality. Unlike the Chinese brands, the Sony headphones are among the best bluetooth headphones I've heard with Aptx, deep relatively honest bass, defined mids, and detailed highs without anything being overdone or fatiguing. They also play far louder than any other Bluetooth headphone I've tried. And even cranked up they remain surprisingly well composed.\n\nYou get what you pay for and these blow away anything from Bose or Beats at any price. And, while it might not be fair to compare them to cheaper Chinese brands, just know there's a night and day difference. These are a Japanese Lexus and the Chinese headphones are some crappy Chang'an poor copy of a cheap economy car. The Bose and Beats are all about marketing and milking their brands. Beats spends more money on the packaging for some of their headphones than the headphones themselves if that tells you anything. Sony has shamed Bose, Beats, and especially the Chinese.",

      "title": "I have encountered no problems with the Bluetooth connection.",
      "body": "I am happy with the sound quality of this headphone and with the Bluetooth connectivity. I had read several reviews complaining about bluetooth problems but I followed through with the purchase as I expected to have the headphones only inches from my phone. I have been using only the LDAC maximized for sound quality which should stress the Bluetooth connection. I have at times left my phone (a Pixel 3 XL) sitting near my laptop and walked into another room so that there were several sheets of drywall along the direct path between the two. I have seen no problems even with that separation. This leaves me wondering what was happening to people who had problems. What follows is speculation as I cannot recreate (and hence correct) any problems.\n\nOne possibility is the Bluetooth is competing with other signals in the 2 GHz band such as WIFI. In theory all else being equal they should be compatible but in a strong multipath environment like a house that compatibility may break down. I have minimized the devices in our house that use 2 GHz WIFI so that the AP sending out beacon packets is generally the only active emitter. So I would suggest anyone having a problem look for WIFI devices on 2GHz and see if shutting them down helps.\n\nAnother possibility is some device arcing. That could be a switch that is not making a firm connection, an outlet that is loose or even wiring in the house that is not firmly connected. Twice I have found flakey connections of house wiring to outlets where the push-in spring loaded connection was used. I have also encountered a temperature cutoff switch on a ceiling fixture that was not IC rated but had insulation over it and had become intermittent. Note that all of these are potential fire hazards in addition to creating RF noise. It may be possible to track down these sources of noise using a portable AM receiver.\n\nYet another possibility comes from potential failure modes for switching power supplies which could lead to them emitting RF noise. This kind of noise could be harder to track down as it can be concentrated in particular parts of the spectrum. Powering down as many devices as possible is a first step in isolating the cause.\n\nIt is also possible that the problem was a defective device or a firmware problem at one end of the connection or even an interaction between the firmware at the two ends. That kind of problem would be frustrating to track down as an end user.\n\nGiven my experience I would suggest that the problems that have occurred are not due to an underlying failure in the design of the Bluetooth system on the headset but rather something specific to the environment or devices being used. I understand the frustration experienced by someone in that situation but generalizing to suggest the product is not capable of being used via bluetooth does not seem appropriate.",

      "title": "Better than Bose",
      "body": "After weeks of research and comparison, I bought a pair of Sony WH1000XM3. A week later, my wife surprised me with a pair of Bose QC 35s (forgetting that I had already purchased the Sony's). I opened the Bose QC in order to test them, figuring I would keep the better of the two and sell the others.\n\nThe reviews I had read were pretty much even between the two. Nothing really gave me confidence that one was better for my uses or my preferences than the other. Now after having both, I can say that I strongly prefer and recommend the Sony over the Bose.\n\nFirst and foremost - the sound out of the Sony WH1000XM3 is not only better, but you can customize it using the app.\nTweak everything about the sound in the app. This is, to me the biggest point because the Bose QC 35's are surprisingly lacking in bass. I own a pair of Bose SoundSports which are great for working out, with great bass right out of the box - which is why I was so surprised that the QC would pack less of a punch than their in-ear buds. The Sony WH1000XM3 out of the box sounds good, but the ability to customize the sound through the equalizer in the app is a huge advantage over the Bose QC 35s.\n\nThe touch controls on the Sony are great as well. Intuitive and responsive. The controls on the Bose are straight forward and work fine, but I do like the ability to just reach up and swipe, tap, or put my hand over the ear cup to hear the ambient sounds as opposed to finding the right button (first world problem, I know, but it is a great feature).\n\nThe noise canceling is indistinguishable to me. Both work great. I could not tell a difference as I switched between the two of them while watching TV, or observing the kids while arguing. I wore the Sony for a 2.5 hour flight with no fatigue or discomfort at all. Not sure about the Bose, but I don't think they would cause any issues or discomfort - they feel pretty much the same on the head/ears.\n\nA couple additional small wins for Sony:\nThe fact that the case comes with small sectioned off areas separated by cloth for your 3.5mm jack and USB. Bose does not have this, which means you can use the pocket on the cover (one inside and one outside) but if you use the one inside the cords are pressed into the ear cups.\nSony uses USB-C. No guessing which side is up when plugging into the headphones to charge.\nSony comes with an Airplane jack adapter. Even though most airlines use the single prong input now, it's nice to have, just in case.\n\nIf Bose had an equalizer, the sound could most likely be made to be equal, if not better than the Sony. But the equalizer feature on the Sony WH1000XM3 enables me to really dial in the sound, leaving the Bose sounding flat in comparison. That alone puts them over the top for me. The additional features alone would not be enough for me to accept inferior quality, but I don't have to. All of it together puts Sony way out ahead in my opinion.",

      "title": "WORTH EVERY PENNY, BUT NOT PERFECT!",
      "body": "I bought the Sony WH1000XM3 after researching headphones for about six months. I hesitated to buy them, after reading some pretty terrible negative reviews regarding build quality, sound quality, and noise cancelling. However, having purchased and used them on an airline flight, plus many hours of listening pleasure in my home, I now have a clear picture of the positive and negative aspects of these headphones.\n\nAs background, I live in central Florida, where it doesn't get very cold. Further, I never use my headphones on a laptop or to speak on a cell phone, so the concerns some reviewers posted about issues involving those situations don't affect me. I don’t wear these headphones everyday and I don’t use them for gaming; I use them with a pad for occasionally listening to music at home and have used them on one airline flight. Further, I have no connection at all to Sony and what follows is my honest evaluation.\n\nPOSITIVE\n1) Sound Quality - Very muddy and bass-heavy until equalized with their app. Afterward, fantastic sound; maybe the best I’ve ever heard.\n2) Ambient Noise-Cancelling (ANC) - Simply outstanding. Almost completely neutralized all of the ambient noise on a full airline flight. Once I started playing music, there was no ambient noise whatsoever. Couldn't even hear a baby crying right behind me!\n3) Battery Life - Excellent. I was never able to come even close to using all the battery power at one sitting. Probably the best feature, other than the quality of the sound and the ANC.\n4) Comfort - I have had no problem wearing these headphones for several hours at a time.\n5) Design - Very mixed emotions on this issue. Love the fold-away storage feature and solid build quality, but hate the touchpad volume controls, which just about every time I used them inadvertently skipped to the next music track. No issues with apparent durability, but I have only owned them for a couple of months and don’t wear them everyday.\n6) Bluetooth - No drop-out issues, but experienced a couple of other negative issues related to the app and limited Bluetooth pairing (see next section).\n\nNEGATIVE\n1) App – The app cannot be downloaded or used on an iPad, which stinks, as I prefer to use my pad, not my phone, for listening to music. In order to use the app at all (which I desperately needed to do, as without equalization these headphones do NOT sound that good; too muddy), I had to load the app on my phone, delete the device from my pad, equalize the device from my phone, delete the device from my phone, and then add the device back to my pad. Further, now I cannot use the app to customize my device, unless I go through the same nonsense all over again. Ridiculous! The app should be compatible with pads, as well.\n2) Bluetooth pairing – Limiting Bluetooth pairing to one device is simply ridiculous for a supposed top-of-the-line product. This was a terrible mistake by Sony.\n3) Touchpad volume controls - Great in concept, awful in execution (even in warm weather). Would probably work fine if the device wasn't being worn on my head, as swiping the pad in an exact up-and-down or front-to-back motion would then be easy. However, when wearing these headphones, the swiping motion to control the volume almost always resulted in skipping to the next music track. I finally gave up and now I control the volume from my pad. Not a show-stopper, but a horrible design feature.\n\nOVERALL\nWhat a shame that Sony hit a grand slam with the sound quality, ANC effectiveness, and outstanding battery life of these headphones, only to strike out on app compatibility, limited Bluetooth pairing, and those ridiculous touchpad controls. I originally started to rate these headphones at 5 stars, but then as I started thinking about the problems I had with the app, the touchpad controls, and the preposterous limitation on Bluetooth pairing, I reduced this review to a more realistic 3 stars. However, these headphones sound and work great, easily at the 5-star level, when only considering sound quality, ANC effectiveness, and battery life. Further, even with the negative aspects mentioned, I still love these headphones, as they definitely get the job done for me, by isolating me completely from ambient noise when I'm in an airport or on a crowded flight. For me, these headphones are worth the money and I can live with the known negatives. Other people may feel differently. If Sony redesigned these headphones, to address the negative aspects I mentioned, in my opinion these headphones would easily rate 5 stars.",

      "title": "Great sound but not the most comfortable",
      "body": "We were able to compare Sony WH1000XM3 with Bose QC35II. They are both high quality, but optimized for very different use cases. At the end, I decided to keep Bose and my wife decided to keep Sony.\n\nSony is optimized for music listening. It makes you feel you are sitting inside the orchestra, or as if you are the conductor. If the recording is high quality, you hear every detail and you breathe with the musicians. (Default setting is too bassy, but if you decrease the \"clear bass\" on the equalizer screen in the app, it becomes better.)\n\nBose, on the other hand, does not immerse you in the music. You feel like sitting among audience, you are not the conductor. You can put a mental distance between you and the music, so that you can concentrate on other things while listening music. Don't get me wrong, the sound is still high quality. And it let's you work.\n\nSony's \"ambient sound control\" is very impressive and innovative. Previous to testing it, I did not understand what they are doing from the advertisements and from other reviews. I thought they just let you control the level of noise cancelling, like Bose does. What they actually do is a kind of \"anti-noise-cancelling\". When you want to hear your surrounding while listening music, you turn surrounding noise on, and the headphone amplifies the surrounding noise for you, blending it with the music. You can put a human voice filter to this amplified surrounding noise so that you hear people but not other low-pitch sounds. They simply cancel out both active and passive noise canceling when you use this feature. You hear people as if you are not wearing any headphones. Isn't that the coolest thing? I can still be around, conversing with people while listening music privately. One thing they can improve in this feature is that I actually want to amplify human sound around me more than the natural levels. It is because I am hearing the music but other people don't, so they don't talk as loudly as they would if they heard the music. Even if I hear them at the same level, I still need to turn the music down to understand them.\n\nIf you are walking and listening music, forget Sony. You will hear your steps as \"thud\"s, 3 times louder than Bose. If you will make a phone call or a conference call on your computer, again forget Sony. Its mic is surprisingly horrible. People won't hear you. I wonder if that can be fixed with a new firmware.\n\nThe touch controls on Sony is brilliant, works very nice. I can skip a song in a second, with swipe of a finger. With Bose, I have to search for that multi-function button every time with my right thumb and double click on it. Takes about 5 seconds.\n\nThe main reason I prefer Bose is because its ear cups are bigger and deeper. Sony hurts my ears after an hour. I am fine indefinitely with Bose. But my wife is comfortable with both of them. She may have smaller ears than me.\n\nThe main reason my wife decided to keep Sony is because it has much better noise cancellation; she does not get distracted while working.\n\nFrom this review I learned that there is no one ideal headphone to get. Sony can improve by making ear cups wider and deeper, working on that thud sound, and using a decent microphone. Bose can improve by copying the touch controls. Even though its sound quality is inferior, I prefer that while I am working. Do you want to feel like in the studio every time you listen to music? I don't.\n\nOne last note .. Sony says it supports aptX low latency codec so that you can use it for watching tv and hearing sounds synchronized with people's lip movements. Bose does not support that. But I have to admit that I don't notice any latency when watching Netflix on my phone with Bose. Maybe that is not very important, or there is something specific to tv that I don't know.",

      "title": "Honest review, compared to Bose QuietComfort 35 II, and Sony WH-H900N",
      "body": "The sound in these is a little better than the Bose, but some of it feels a little artificial, ie. not a true reproduction of the sound, but somehow enhanced (not that the Bose are so much better). Note that in wired mode, while turned off/charging (ie. passive mode), the sound quality is pretty bad! Also, they let you listen to them while charging, but they give you a 6\" charging cable... thanks Sony.\n\nThe Bose are a little more comfortable, about half the weight as these, and I could wear them all day, but I need a break with these after a couple of hours here and there. These stick out from the head more than the Bose. I could sleep with the Bose on cause they were flatter, but not so much with these. They also fall off a little easier than the Bose.\n\nThe noise cancelling in these is about the same as the Bose (I did a side-by-side comparison), but the Bose put you in more a vacuum/isolated environment, which is sometimes preferable.\n\nThe bluetooth connection in these is a little better than the Bose, doesn't really skip much (sometimes does even when Bluetooth device is close), whereas the Bose seemed to skip a little more whenever there was some interference or strong brain waves. Also it should be known that these will only connect to one device at a time, and when doing so (switching devices), sometimes you have to power them on and off and reconnect, as it will say connected, but audio won't actually play through them, which is a small annoyance, whereas the Bose didn't do this, and could connect to multiple devices at a time, and could use a custom device name.\n\nThe touch controls on these are cool, but also not perfect (ie. changing volume might accidentally change song, vice versa, or won't respond and have to try twice, not common but it happens), and also with a slight response delay. Sometimes I feel like I would prefer haptic/buttons more. Also, when powering on or off, you have to hold the power button for a full 3 seconds or so. I don't know why they couldn't make it a little shorter. Just being picky there. The Bose turn on and off right away with a switch.\n\nOverall they're nice headphones, maybe only worth about $250 imho. I would probably return them and go back to the Bose if the Bose didn't have it's known Bluetooth issues, and supported hi-fi bluetooth streaming like these do.\n\nI should also add... if you run these in the highest-quality mode (ie. 990kbps), it will interfere with your wifi! Even on your phone, you'll notice the wifi become very much interfered with when using the phone while wearing the headphones. If you drop the quality down to 660kbps, it doesn't really affect it so much (330kbps is the lowest setting).\n\nUpdate with WH-H900N h.Ear 2:\nI recently sent the XM3's back and bought the WH-H900N h.ear 2 model, as I found them for much cheaper on eBay and the features are nearly identical. The WH-H900N is about the same as the WH-1000XM3, in all aspects (including high-quality streaming and touch controls), with these differences:\n-The 900N's are a little tighter around the head, but can wear them about the same length of time as the XM3's.\n-The 900N's noise cancelling and isolation is just as good as the XM3's, sufficient enough and well worth the price I paid for them.\n-The 900N's touch-sensitive controls are more responsive, and react immediately when you touch them. Surprisingly, the XM3's are less so, with a slight delay, so I prefer the 900N's in this regard.\n-The 900N's quick charge (10 mins) only gives you about an hour, while the XM3's give you 5 hours in 10 minutes.\n\nHope it helps.",

      "body": "I bought into the hype that these were some of the best \"average joe that really likes bass\" type of product...mildly dissapointed.\n\nThe sound is great, it feels great, it feels full, but only for the first time of trying it. The first time I tried it I thought these were the best in the market and they were worth the hype. Overtime (half a day) I realized that they sound... strange, muddy what have you. I messed with the equalizer for the next week and could not find a preset to suit my taste. I'd have to constantly switch between them depending on the genre of music that comes up.\n\nIt does not help that they start to feel heavy and make my ears hot even in cold weather! I find myself reaching for the cheaper Bose Soundlink 2 more often than not due to comfort and because my ears get fatigued from too much bass and I feel discomfort. Let's talk about that.\n\nNow, let me begin with saying that I have small ears. I would imagine someone with bigger ears would feel more discomfort than me, or maybe I'm special. I seriously tried to wear these headphones for longer than 3 hours and the result was having a weird ringing in my ear. It felt like I had tinnitus symptoms. For the following hours it would calm down but my ears would heat up much faster than usual when I wore the headphones again. It's almost as if they got accustomed to getting hot quickly.\n\nThe noise canceling is... Great. It's great at blocking out sounds and it's great at giving you a funny feeling in your ear almost like air is being sucked out of your ear despite using the optimizer in their application. If you use the ANC, you better have something loud playing because the suction feeling is almost impossible to get use to while listening to softer music. I don't use it that often because of that reason. I find myself not needing to use ANC since the music usually blocks out a lot of the sound around me.\n\nThe swipe feature to pause and skip songs is great, it has not missed or made a single mistake when using it; though I do heavily prefer buttons. Having to hold down the power button for 3+ seconds just to power the thing on and turn it off is such a step backwards from my Bose Headphones where I only need to flip a switch and it INSTANTLY connects. Less than half a second.\n\nMy final verdict is a 4/5. I did point out a lot of flaws as opposed to positives yet gave it a high rating, but that's the point of a review. I want the consumer to understand the negatives as well, not just the positives. There certaintly are much better sounding headphones for a cheaper price but without ANC. If it weren't for how well they performed at blocking sound without ANC despite giving me slight discomfort, this review would be a 3 star. Thanks for reading.",

      "title": "Comparison to Bose QuietComfort 35s",
      "body": "I have both this and a recently purchased set of Bose 35s. I have used both extensively on commercial flights, as well as in quiet rooms to assess the sound quality. Bottom line up front: the reviewers are right, the Sony's do have better noise cancelling, and the sound quality is on par (if not better) than the Bose set.\n\nWhere the Sony wins\n------------------------\n\nNoise cancelling. The Sony does a slightly better job of drowning out airplane hum, and seems to have a higher frequency range at which it can cancel than the Bose. It also has less background hiss than the Bose (in fact, has none I can hear) though the Bose doesn't have much to speak of. The Sony can run a test to tune the noise cancelling based on your altitude and the way you're wearing the headset, making it less sensitive to how you're wearing the headphones. I've found the Bose, by comparison, has differing levels of performance depending on how you're wearing them.\n\nOne of the nicest things about the Sony is that you can tailor everything from the app, ranging from noise cancellation settings (e.g. you can allow voice to come through) to equalization and bass response.\n\nThe interface to the Sony is also superior, with very intuitive swipe commands on the right earpiece taking care of most functions. Want to increase the volume, swipe up. Skip the song, swipe right. Want to hear what the flight attendant is saying to you, hold your hand over the ear piece and the noise cancelling switches to a mode where you can hear voices. Much easier than fumbling around for buttons on your head or trying to use your phone.\n\nWhere the Bose is better\n---------------------------\n\nBuild quality. The Bose is arguably better made, and has more metal components and softer, higher quality padding. There are stories of the Sony breaking rather easily. Something they've supposedly fixed in recent builds, but even still, the Bose headsets are clearly sturdier. That said, I have been using the Sonys for a few months and haven't run into any problems.\n\nMultiple Bluetooth pairing. The Bose set can pair to two devices simultaneously, and you can actually hear both. The Sony can pair with two devices, but you can only really use one at a time, and switching between them requires a bit of work. So, the Bose wins if you really need to be using two devices at once (e.g. your computer and a phone).\n\nWhere they are equal\n------------------------\n\nWhile I slightly prefer the sound of the Sony set better, it's hard to argue they are too far apart. It will mostly be taste. The Bose have much thicker bass, which I don't really like, but both have excellent sound quality, especially for noise cancelling headphones. Neither has much of the \"hiss\" that used to be associated with early noise cancelling headphones, and both have very clear highs.\n\nBottom line\n--------------\n\nGiven the better noise cancelling and customization of the Sony, it's become the headset that I regularly use now, and unless you really need dual device Bluetooth pairing, you can't go wrong with the Sony.",

      "body": "After a few days of use I must admit that I have started to notice things that I would like to be better, but know there likely are no better headphones on the market that combine all of the things I wanted these to do. The noise cancelling is not what I expected it to be, but they are my first pair and I likely expected the technology to be somewhere more advanced than it is. Higher frequencies and non-periodic noise make it through much more than periodic noise and lower frequencies. The fact that it handles periodic noise so well makes me wonder if it is running an FFT to efficiently find frequencies to intelligently cancel, or that I just happen to be around periodic noises that are effectively cancelled by these headphones. Anyway, stuff like music at Starbucks makes its way through, but with significant attenuation, to the point I can't hear Starbucks-level music over my own music, but I can between songs (though it isn't annoying).\n\nThey are light and pretty comfortable for someone with pretty big ears, but I find myself taking them off a few times per hour to give my ears some air to cool down. When I am looking down at a book or something, they like to slide down unless they are tighter, which I accept because these cause a serious case of headphone hair if you have them on tight enough to prevent this (which isn't desirable when you are in public). But, they are pretty comfortable. I expected worse for closed back headphones.\n\nThe sound is quite nice and I deal with the extra bass to make sure the audio is coming in at high quality when I am listening to my FLAC files. When streaming, I would recommend just change the EQ to your liking because your music will NOT be anywhere near audiophile quality unless you pay specifically for it to be. Comparing them to my open back headphones, the difference is very clear. Not necessarily in quality, but in how it sounds. I personally prefer the sound of the open back, but they are awful to use in public and these are likely the best option to go for when you need to be in your own space in public, yet not bug people with your music (which is a really annoying issue these days, for some reason...).\n\nI work in a physics lab and this is where I really appreciated these headphones. I have a bunch of fans on electronics running and vacuum pumps, large AC units, etc and the noise is annoying as can be. I put these on an even without music I entered a whole new world. I can't see myself working without these anymore. The lack of cable is why I got them for my lab (the ANC was for public), but the ANC became a really great aspect of these for my lab life. I was hesitant for a while about paying $350 for these, but being in the lab with them made up my mind-worth it (but now I don't hear my boss come in which can be awkward).\n\nThe case is amazing... though the storage pouch on the outside is on the bottom.... WHY? You made the interior separators so that you can't move them and then put the mesh pouch on the bottom... such a weird design choice. Otherwise, the case is amazing, despite the pathetically short USB-c cable that came with it. That was a really dumb way to save a few cents that did not go unnoticed. But, the entire package is worth it.",

      "body": "I bought the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones for myself and the Bose 700 headphones as a gift for a friend, and I had the chance to test both of them out.\n\nPro:\nI mostly use the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones to listen to Spotify on my iPhone and Windows 10 PC and for that they work great. The music quality is enjoyable... better than Bose 700 headphones. The Bose 700 headphones don't sound bad, they are fine, but they seem muddy in the bass and lack transparency. I much prefer the sound of the Sony.\n\nThe Sony headphones cancel out the sounds that usually distract me, so they are great in that area. They are equal to or perhaps better than the Bose 700 headphones in noise cancelling. I would call it a draw.\n\nThe Sony app is better than the Bose app because it allows easier control of the headphones and unlike Bose, Sony does not require the user to register and agree to waive all of their privacy rights in order to access the full features of the headphones. Win to Sony.\n\nSo-So:\nI have used five other Bluetooth devices for calls, mostly in the $100 range, and these expensive Sony headphones are the first device where someone I am speaking to has complained about the sound quality. I didn't think that the Sony played their voice in my ear very well, either. Curious, I called a friend and did an A/B blind comparison between the two headphones to compare their sound quality. My friend said that the Bose 700 headphone call quality was \"perfect.\" She said the Sony sounded \"find but kind of boomy.\" She didn't know which headphone was which, but she preferred hearing my voice while I was wearing the Bose. In my ears, her voice did not sound particularly great when I wore either of the headphones. Both headphones seemed to reproduce voices with some static. Your experience may vary, but I was expecting these headphones to beat the cheap bluetooth ear pieces I have in my collection.\n\nThe Sony and Bose headphones connect to my iPhone and Surface Laptop via Bluetooth very quickly and they work well with no dropouts.\n\nI found it tricky to connect the Sony and Bose headphones to my old desktop PC that is five years old or older, and when I did get the headphones from these two brands to connect I experienced dropouts in the signal, which was annoying. I probably need to buy a new desktop PC, and when I do I expect that the headphones will work as well with the new computer as they do with my iPhone and Microsoft Surface Laptop.\n\nPlastic Smell: The Sony headphones do not have that cheap plastic smell some products do. The Bose do have that awful smell. If you are sensitive to that off-gassing odor, then the Bose headphones will dissappoint you.\n\nAs noise cancelling headphones for listening to music go, the Sony do a great job and I recommend them. Still, I am curious to try the new Microsoft Surface 2 headphones to see how those ones compare for making calls.",

      "body": "I had to order these twice and they were not quick about getting them to me. Both times, the wrong charging chord was in the case. The first set of headphones, I borrowed the correct chord and it would not even hold the charge. I emailed the company and got no response. I ordered a second set after sending the first ones back. I had to buy the correct chord for the second set of headphones as well. I waited for the second set for a long time. These are excellent headphones in terms of sound and noise cancelling quality, but you will not be able to charge them unless you purchase the correct charging chord separately.",

      "title": "Superior sound quality & excellent noise cancelling!!!",
      "body": "First, I will say that I consider myself a \"sensible audiophile\" in that I'm picky about sound quality, but not to the level of being a delusional fanatic. I'm also comparing these to the Bose QC-35 II that I tried prior to upgrading to this wonderful Sony WH-1000XM3. The sound quality is far superior to the Bose - highs, upper midrange, midrange, and bass are much more detailed and accurate than the Bose. I will say that the Bose seems to hit the deepest frequencies (30Hz & lower, with signal generator app) a little bit better but this is insignificant compared to the overall superior sound quality of the Sony. Sony's superior sound is due in part to support for superior Bluetooth codecs such as Apt-X & LDAC; the Bose only supports the basic & lossy SBC & AAC codecs. Sound quality remains excellent even when using a corded connection with the headphones completely turned off; the same cannot be said about the Bose which has poor sound quality with a corded connection. Call quality is good - many say that call quality is bad with these, I didn't experienced that based on the two people that i talked to with these, but I did not talk outside in a noisy environment. Battery life is excellent - lasts a lot longer than the Bose (Sony rated battery life: 30hrs, Bose: 20hrs) The bad about the Sony: Comfort could be better because the earcups are too shallow resulting in your ears resting against the fabric/foam liner that covers the drivers. It's not overly uncomfortable, but can make your ears feel warm with extended listening and there is scratching sound when shifting the headphones around. Touch controls for volume/next track are annoying to use and sometimes result in inadvertent actuation (can be disabled if desired). I much prefer the Bose's traditional hard buttons. Bluetooth connection options are not as good as the Bose - these do not allow you to connect to more than one device at the same time, like say your laptop and your phone. Also, switching between more than one device is not as seamless as with the Bose - with the Bose, all you have to do is briefly slide the power/Bluetooth switch and it will move to the next device stored in its memory list. With the Sony, you have to disconnect the device and reconnect the other device. In summary, sound quality & noise cancelling is better with the Sony. Comfort and Bluetooth ease use is better with the Bose.\nUpdate: These can connect to more than one device at the same time! I had the headphones connected to my laptop (for music) and to my phone (for calls) at the same time! To do so, you pair each item individually, then disconnect them. Then, you pair it with your music player first and play the music. Then you connect your phone which will connect for calls.",

      "title": "Tech Tips",
      "body": "After reading several reviews about how great the Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM3 are and several reviews about software/hardware nightmares, I was a bit hesitant to purchase this headset. From my own past experience, I tend to stay away from Sony products (due to their historical lack of documentation and updating nightmares). However, these headphones have everything I was searching for in a headset. So, I decided to give them a try. I have to say that the headset works as advertised, which is good to know. Other audiophiles have already posted their reviews so I'm not going to do that here. Instead, I decided to post some tech tips that may help avoid the software/hardware nightmares.\n\n(1) The box only has quick setup and reference guides. If you'd like the help guide, use your favorite search engine and search for Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM3. Select the link from Sony.com.\n\n(2) On the Sony website (across the top of the page), select Support. Then, Support again in the drop down.\n\n(3) On the Welcome to Sony Support page, search for Sony Noise Cancelling Headphones WH1000XM3. The first result (or one of the first results) will be Help Guide (Web manual) (WH-1000XM3). Click that link. It will bring you to the online Help Guide that is also available as a Printable PDF (click button to view). I highly recommend downloading the PDF. It has 130 pages of useful info.\n\nUPGRADING THE HEADSET SOFTWARE\n\n(1) Before upgrading the headset software, you must disconnect the phone assistant (Google, Siri, Alexa).\n\n(a) Open the Sony | Headset Connect software on your phone.\n(b) Scroll to Change function of [NC/AMBIENT] button. Change the selection from your phone assistant (Google, Siri, Alexa) to Ambient Sound Control.\n\n(2) Make sure the headset (and your cell phone) has at least 50% power.\n\n(a) The update could take as long as 60 minutes. From my own experience, it took 20 minutes. I did it at home using my Wi-Fi connected cell phone. If your phone connects to LTE only, it will take longer than mine. Therefore, make sure your headset (and cell phone) has enough power before upgrading as the update will cause a slight battery drain. If the headset or phone battery dies during the upgrade, it may render the headset inoperable.\n\n(3) Do not upgrade the headset on the go (plane, train, car).\n\n(a) This reason should be obvious after reading step 2. However, I will attempt to explain. Your phone needs a reliable internet connection to download and install the software. If you're on the go, you're just asking for problems.\n\nIf you've upgraded the headset already and are having problems (because you did not know about the caveats beforehand), perform a factory reset and try again. I have not personally gone through this step, so I am not sure if this will work. But, it is worth a shot. The information on how to do a factory reset is in the Sony Help Guide (printable PDF).",

      "title": "Good, but not as good as the MDR 1000X",
      "body": "I bought this new pair when my Sony MDR 1000X finally broke in the same way that many other people experienced with that product. That pair was excellent except for the physical flaw that eventually caused them to break, so I was hoping the new one would measure up.\n\nTHE GOOD: In terms of sound quality and noise canceling, they work very well. The Wirecutter claimed there's a sensation of \"eardrum suck,\" but I don't get that at all. The right cup gesture controls still work well toplay/pause, control volume, rewind/fast-forward, and skip ahead. The swipe-foward-and-hold in order to fast-forward isn't my favorite control method, but it does work (mostly; see below). So far, they've proven to be just as durable as the MDR 1000X were before they broke. It also looks like there's been a change in the design of the arch (What DO you call that part?) so that it appears to concentrate force more vertically; hopefully that will prevent the breakage that us MDR 1000X owners experienced.\nThe battery life is still excellent, and this model seems to charge much faster than the MDR 1000X did.\n\nTHE BAD: The biggest complaint I have is that the headphones often lose the right cup controls, so I'll be double-tapping like crazy in order to pause the podcast I'm listening to, all to no avail. It's not clear what causes this; sometimes I'll be at the edge of Bluetooth range for the phone and get audio stutter, and when I move back in range, the controls are still working. Other times, I'll do the same thing, and they aren't. Sometimes the controls aren't working and I've never been out of range of my phone. There's no way to discern the cause. The software app seems like it should allow for a lot more customization than it does. I would really like to be able to set the double-tap length, but I don't see an option for it. I like the voice notifications for everything except the notification when the headphones drop to 10% battery; I don't need that warning, I always use them until they shut off and then recharge them. I wish I could shut off that one notification, but you have to shut off all voice prompts or none, and the info panel seems to imply that the battery notification might not shut off even if you do turn off all voice prompts.\nThe controls on the right ear cup work most times, but often they have trouble discerning between when I'm changing the volume and when I'm trying to fast forward a podcast. Sometimes the fast-forward gets detected as a skip. I would really love to be able to change it so that a single swipe forward is a 15-second fast-forward while swipe-forward-and-hold skips to the next podcast, because I use the latter far more frequently.\nThe change from a leather cover to plastic on the outside of the ear cups makes them feel cheaper. It was a nice luxe touch on the MDR 100X that is gone.\n\nI would still recommend these headphones to people, but without the enthusiasm that I recommended my pre-breakage MDR 1000Xs. I don't know if I would go back to Sony over-the-ear phones the next time I'm in the market for noise canceling headphones.",

      "title": "Awesome Noise Cancelling!",
      "body": "To preface this review, I didn't buy these headphones with the intention of using them in my home. I do a lot of travel for work, and finally decided it was time to get a good pair of noise cancelling headphones to cancel out the sound of the stupid children and dumba** babies that don't know it's not polite to scream and cry on an airplane (absolutely insufferable). At home I have a pair of Sennheiser HD650s which is an absolutely marvelous pair of open, over-the-ear headphones. They are pretty top of the line when it comes to sound quality.\n\nSo onto the actual review. The first day I got them I put them on as I worked from home, with no music playing, the sounds of the refrigerator and AC running were practically muted, a very good first impression. Listening to music, the quality was ok, but as I said in my previous paragraph, I have a pair of HD650s which I am used to that are VERY good. So after work I had to take a break from wearing the headphones and went to Winghouse for guys night with a few friends (staff/food/company all on point for the night).\n\nI eventually had to make my way back to my two bedroom apartment that I share with my ex-girlfriend. However, this night was a little different, because apparently it was time to wash her entire wardrobe and do 6 loads of laundry and have a friend over talking over the washer/dryer in her room. To give some perspective on the situation, it's a pretty small apartment, the washer/dryer sits right across from my bedroom door, and her bedroom door is right adjacent to the washer/dryer. Meanwhile I was trying to finish off the night by watching some Full Metal Alchemist and playing a little Rocket League (C1 for those that are curious). The Sennheiser headphones that I own are open back, which means you can hear everything around you with these on, which is generally great when living alone so you can be aware of your surroundings, but tonight that wasn't gonna cut it. So I grabbed the Sonys of my ownies, popped those bad boys on and something happened that I have been wanting to have happen for quite some time. My ex was practically deleted from existence (well not really, but if I close my eyes and don't look it's almost like the same thing). I couldn't hear the washer/dryer, and more importantly I couldn't her my ex and her company. I took them off and looked at them for some sort of special or strange mark left by an interstellar Wizard, because these things are out of this world. Alas, I found nothing, but I really didn't care so I put them back on to resume muting the surrounding world. Absolutely incredible!",

      "title": "Great design/features and decent sound but overambitious touch controls with a potential fatal flaw.",
      "body": "I had high hopes for these headphones as I needed a good set of cans for my commute. I had really grown accustomed to entry-level \"audiophile\" over-ear headphones like the Audio Technica M50x but despite their decent passive noise isolation, ambient noise in the subway or walking across the George Washington Bridge sometimes drowned them out. I wanted a set of more portable, wireless, noise-canceling headphones and read that these struck a good balance. I did not expect audiophile quality sound. So let me break it down by categories:\n\nSound (3-4/5): Decent. These are not \"audiophile\" grade by any means. They are pleasant, warm, easy to listen to (not fatiguing), better than most ear buds, decent bass (though it can overlap with low mids), and with the equalizer can be customized a bit to fit your preference. But compared to audiophile grade they are not as detailed or clear. Still, for a set of active noise canceling headphones loaded with features, it's a good enough sound for a commute.\n\nNoise-canceling (4/5): Very good. In some settings it is really impressive and makes the whole world seem to disappear. Obviously it can't block out unpredictable transient sounds and it won't completely eliminate very loud low frequency rumbles (like the subway) but certainly dampens them impressively. One disappointment is its handling of wind noise. Wind sometimes seems to feed into the headphones. I think this is because the microphones are picking up the wind and failing at canceling it (so it ends up getting transmitted into the headphone). It's not a fatal flaw and typically not a major problem unless the wind is really strong. But this is the reason ANC doesn't get 5/5.\n\nBuild (4/5): Although it initially feels like a plastic toy I grew to like the build over the time. It is light and sleek. Nothing much to say about it. I suspect durability could be an issue but haven't had them long enough.\n\nComfort (5/5): I thought they were very soft and comfortable. Not too much clamping force.\n\nControls (2/5): This is the potential fatal flaw. I would have given this a 1/5 but I do like the concept of the touch controls and when they are working well it is very convenient. I wouldn't have minded occasional hiccups but here is where the real issue. On cold and/or windy days, the touch controls were spontaneously activate. This would cause voice assist to activate randomly or tracks to pause/skip. It made the headphones unusable outdoors on cold and/or windy days. In addition, a few times the controls stopped working, then became fritzy. I had to turn off/on the headphones to get them to work. This was the most disappointing issue the headphones had. Many people will want them for commuting which for many involves being outdoors. This problem essentially renders them unusable for this application. In normal indoor environments (or airplanes I suspect) they work well.\n\nOther features/misc (5/5): Loaded with neat features (some useful, some fun). Decent phone app with equalizer. Interesting ANC optimization and settings (though sometimes don't work that great). Great foldability and semi-rigid case make them very portable.\n\nOverall (3/5): Great for indoor use or warm climates but potentially fatal flaw for those hoping to use them to commute in cold weather. I will likely have to return them. Also be aware that fakespot.com grades the reviews with an \"F\" suggesting high deception is involved (in contrast to the \"A\" that the Bose QC 35 II have). I will may try the Bose QC 35 II despite possibly inferior sound given they have physical controls, are said to be more comfortable, ANC not affected by wind as much, and are also foldable and portable. Alternatively, I may stick to my M50x or M50xBT or Sennheiser 598cs for better sound quality but no ANC. The ATH-MSR7 is an intriguing possibility given it combines audiophile level sound with active noise canceling (but I haven't loved the sound signature).",

      "title": "Top-of-the-line noise canceling, bottom of the barrel EQ",
      "body": "Sony has been considered one of the best producers of noise canceling headphones for many years, and for good reason. The 1000XM3 is in my opinion their masterpiece when it comes to form, function, and features. It has pros and cons just like any product and the price point is one of them for sure, but \"you get what you pay for\" applies here. Pricey, yes, but a master-class in noise canceling and sound fidelity.\n\nIf only the Equalization wasn't total garbage. Thankfully this is easy to fix with a program like Equalizer APO or an Android equivalent, but the default bass and tone was so bad I actually thought I'd received a defective unit. The bass by default sounds almost as if you are under water, sounds on the deeper end of the spectrum are very muted and uncomfortable. Music with a lot of drum and bass becomes pretty unpleasant to listen to- it's as if you're listening to a car stereo system with the bass kicked up to 11... from the car next to it in traffic. It really cannot be understated just how bad the default balancing is, once the headphones are on and noise canceling is going it's not a pleasant experience.\n\nHowever, it's not like this ruins the product. There is a lot to like about it: The top-of-the-line noise canceling, the nearly as-advertised battery life, and the touch functionality on the ear cups for changing volume or playback just to name a few. They're comfortable for long periods of time and will easily last all day without needing a recharge. Which is good, because the 3.5mm and USB-C cables included are pitifully short, the only other real negative I can think of.\n\nOverall the Sony WH-1000XM3 is far above average in terms of noise canceling, and the sound quality (once balanced properly with an external program) is second-to-none. There are a few small issues that are easily corrected in five minutes on first setup, and from that point forward it's more than worth the premium Sony expects you to pay for it.\n\n(edit 05/21): After quite some use with these, they're still in perfect shape and though I have generally treated them well, it's in no small part to their construction. However I returned here to affirm 4 stars as the noise canceling doesn't seem to be nearly powerful enough for 'sharp' sounds like barking dogs, honking cars, or very high-frequency sounds (like... very small barking dogs). If you're looking to block sounds which occur very quickly like knocking or construction, look for an updated pair or do what I did and save a couple hundred bucks by getting a box fan.",

      "title": "No Real Point of Comparison",
      "body": "Take that title how you want. On the one hand, I don't have a point of comparison. These are my first legit over-the-ear, intended-for-real-listening headphones that didn't cost $20 or less. So, in that case, it's an incredible listening experience. You know that expression, \"Mind Blown\"? Yeah, that. These sound amazing.\n\nOn the other hand, is there really a point to compare? The reviews have said it all. Top in class active noise cancellation. Great sounding headphones. Support for aptX-HD for CD-level clarity. What's not to like about a set of cans like this? And yet, I've already encountered a couple of issues -- nit-picks really:\n\n1) I have already wanted to use it with another Bluetooth device, but hesitated because I know that it can't be paired with more than one device at a time. I know that the Bose QC II do that. These don't. Is it a deal-breaker? Not really. Just a mild inconvenience.\n\n2) The HD quality sound is great. However, if you want to alter the sound stage. Change a setting on the equalizer. Change the surround. You can't opt for the headphones to prioritize sound quality. Did that make sense? Let me say it again: \"You can't prioritize sound quality AND change the sound stage.\" Some might say that they are mutually exclusive. You choose one or the other. While others might want to have audio quality AND adjust the audio to their own sound palette.\n\n3) Coding the Hard Button is odd. Why give one button three options? What if I want Google Assistant/Alexa AND ANC control?\n\n4) Touch controls are great, but not consistent. The worst offender here is the palm mute. What has been described as a simple cupping of the headphone will allow ambient sounds come through, but the palm has to physically be on the whole of the touch pad. Again, not a deal-breaker, but not as magical as it is described.\n\n5) It's plasticky and feels plasticky. I don't know how else to describe it.\n\nSome qualifiable things:\n\na) No perceived latency with videos that I can tell. Lips are in sync with audio. I know some people have said there are issues. For what it's worth, I'm running this through a OnePlus 6T which supports aptX;\n\nb) listening comfort is good. These fit my ears great, but I know that won't be true for everyone. My ears did get a bit warm, but that's to be expected I suppose.\n\nOther than that, other non-qualitative factors, like range, it's good. I can have my phone in the basement of my house and walk all around the home, including to the top floor, opposite end of the house, and still have crystal clear audio.\n\nAfter all that's written here, do I regret this purchase? Absolutely not. There's a wealth of great videos out there comparing these with others by those who've used its competitors. I don't doubt anything that they've said. So, I am sure that I have either the best or second-best headphones on the market. After using them, I don't have any reason to doubt those claims. You won't be disappointed that's for sure!",

      "title": "Sound & ANC awesome, loose cups make me Dennis leery",
      "body": "I've bought plenty of headphones over-the-yEARS, and always try to find some decent ones at affordable prices (under a $100) which I have but they generally don't last longer than a year or two before being unusable (my last pair of $50 off brand bluetooth cans were great but after a year, the ear cups fell apart rather rapidly and rendered them unusable). So I decided to go the right route and buy some top notch Bluetooth headphones and after days of research, decided on these instead of the Bose QC 35 II.\nThe Pro's: Awesome battery life and quick charge. I also love the fact when you tap the physical power button, it tells you the approximate charge you have left. I only had to quick charge 10min one time and it lasted for hours, awesome!\nI do like the non physical touch features for volume, skipping songs, etc. but I live in Los Angeles and I've read plenty of reviews the swiping doesn't work in colder climates so that sucks.\nNo lights that stay on, I absolutely HATE THIS on headphones! The lights stay on as you're connecting but go off and stay off. So many headphones have a light that stays on and it's so annoying. Rant over.\nThe style is really nice, sleek matte black, was kind of thrown off on the pinkish/purple Sony logo. It looked more orange on my phone but no biggie.\nHeadband and ear cups were comfortable even after hours of use.\nUSB-C connection is nice, no worries about it being upside down and charge is fast.\nSounds are very even, remind me of my Sony MDR V6 Studio cans but obviously not as good (wired vs bluetooth). The bass isn't overpowering the other sounds but does kick in when it needs too, awesome sound all around.\nCons:\nThe loose ear cups worry me. I get it that they rotate and all that but they are really loose and I've gone through enough headphones to know that this is going to break within a year or at minimum, get even looser over time. For $350 cans, this was a deal breaker even though I bought these at $300 on sale.\nThe bluetooth pairing. My TV recognizes all bluetooth devices and saves them. But nearly every time I used these headphones, I had to pair them with my TV again which took around 10-15 minutes each time which is a hassle especially when my cheap $50 would connect right away.\nAgain the bluetooth. My bathroom is pretty much unobstructed from my TV and about 15 feet away. These would cut out the minute I walked into my hallway and get intermittent connection while all of my other headphones, including the cheap $50 one, had zero issues, even if I closed the door.\nThe USB-C cord is shorter than short. Annoying and you'll be buying a longer one immediately.\nIn closing:\nI loved these for the sound, style & comfort but hated that it felt like they wouldn't last a year for a $300 purchase.\nThe re-pairing of the connection to my TV 9 out of 10 times was an annoyance that I couldn't deal with anymore and decided to return them and take my chances on a less expensive brand, I will update for sure.\nIf you have faith in the construction of these loose ear cups or are a moderate user, go for it. I use my headphones everyday whether creating music, editing videos, watching TV, riding my bike, etc. I just felt like they weren't designed strong enough for my use. At $100 I would've kept them but for $300 (and now $350), I'd rather find a cheaper alternative.",

      "body": "My background: I'm a 10 year user of Sennheiser open-air HD-595's, and I crave serious sound quality for my music. I also own Logitech G930 for gaming (which basically disintegrated in 2 years).\n\nI live in Florida, where it's hot 9 months out of the year, and constantly have AC going. Both central air, and a window AC unit for support in my room. Thus it is always noisy. I started to look for noise cancelling headphones to connect to my self-built PC, via a bluetooth adapter. I tried Sennheiser HD 4.50, and returned them after 30 minutes of use caused headaches. The active noise cancellation (ANC) was decent, but the sound quality mediocre at best. My HD-595's are amazing for most music, but are open air thus allowing all ambient noise in, as well as projecting sound out (you can hear them through a closed door).\n\nAfter returning the HD 4.50's, i researched ANC headphones and nearly all reviews come down to 2 models, the Bose QC35's and these Sony WH-1000 MK3's. Most reviews I read said the Sony's win overall, especially in sound quality. After getting them, I can see why. They rival my HD-595's in music playback quality, (no small feat), and yet do so over a wireless BT connection. As for bass, they are far superior to the HD-595's.\n\nBut what really amazes me is the ANC. I had the main central air unit on, which is just outside my bedroom window), as well as my window AC on at the same time. Put these on, power up, and it's like magic. The exterior sound just ... vanishes. It's so effective that it induces bewilderment. And keep in mind this is even before I start music playing. I have to take these headphones off now to even be able to tell if either AC unit is running. It's unbelievable.\n\nMusic playback is sublime. Movies and TV are a delight, and gaming is wonderful with these as well.\n\nAs for comfort, I wore them 5+ hours yesterday and basically forgot they were on.\n\nThese headphones are incredible. My only gripe is that they can't pair with more than one device at a time, thus i have to do a lot of fiddling and switching to get them paired to my phone if i wanted to go for a walk with them, then more manual fiddling to get them back on the PC. My understanding is the Bose win in this area with multi-device pairing.\n\nOverall, a dream come true. I can now enjoy music, TV, movies, and games literally sitting right next to a window AC unit and not even be able to hear it.",

For those of you that live in the city and experience the occasional snow storm with accompanying loss of power, do you remember the silence that you heard the last time that this happened? That's what the city sounds like outside of my home when ANC is active. It's downright eerie. It won't tune out voices completely, but for steady noises (vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, air compressors, and especially aircraft engines) it works extremely well. When you're flying, it will make the plane very quiet, but unfortunately it will not tune out that screaming infant behind you. Fortunately, it will dull said infant enough so that cranking the music a bit will mask things.\n\nSound quality is good but not great. The bass is...well, it's not right. It's over emphasized and there's something else wrong with it. I don't think that most folks will notice. If you're listening to podcasts or movies, it's fine. If you're not used to critically listening on high end gear, it's also fine. It sounds a bit off to me but it's not like I was offended by it, and again, movies and podcasts are fine.\n\nThe user's manual is Ikea-style crap and does not highlight the importance of installing Sony's app in order to get the most out of these. While the active noise cancelling is great for aircraft, it can be counterproductive around the house when you want to hear what's going on around you. In its stock mode, the \"ambient noise\" setting (where the headphones amplify outside noises instead of cancelling them out) is crap, but it's actually pretty good if you tune it to your liking in the app.\n\nAs you've probably already seen elsewhere on the internet, battery life is fantastic. They're not kidding with those figures. These things run for days.\n\nMy complaints are that the ear cups are just a hair small for my ears (I have large ears), the manual sucks, and the head phones don't work as well as they should unless you use the app. The swiping volume control can also be fiddly, but that's normally not an issue for me; you can also control the volume on whatever device is transmitting to the headphones and that's not fiddly at all in my case, so I normally just set my volume on my phone or iPad and ignore this feature.\n\nIf you want to listen to stuff while hearing your surroundings, these headphones are great. If you'd rather not hear your surroundings, they're also great. When I lent these to my girlfriend, she immediately bought a pair. I'm not an expert on ANC headphones but I'm extremely happy with these. 4 stars because 4.5 stars is not an option and while my complaints are minor, they're still complaints, and I don't give people five stars if I have something to complain about.\n\nWell done, Sony.",

      "body": "The noise cancellation on these is absolutely amazing. Truly second to nobody. Proof is in the scientific measurements, which I checked out after purchase. They can be found online at the rtings review website. They offer a full cancellation frequency response charts, and you can plot any two headsets on a single graph. Clear winner: this new headset.\n\nSound is amazing. Few tips and tricks as an Android user:\n\nI very much like having HI DEFINITION BLUETOOTH. *EXCEPT*... you have to use with caution. Notice the bass is a tad heavy on these, and the treble is a tad lacking. I prefer rather flat response to perfectly reproduce the recording. Now... if someone takes just a touch off bass and adds a tad on treble in the headphone app by Sony, then Hi-Def Bluetooth gets disabled, and you are stuck with standard def. HOWEVER, if you do that same little tweak to the audio BEFOREHAND, say in the Google Music app, then hi-def bluetooth remains active.\n\nOne common complaint I have seen on reviews here that I have made to Sony directly, and will make again, until they fix it. (You listening, Sony??? I'm waiting for the Firmware Update. I'll check tonight. Honestly haven't checked in a couple of months.) - - - When on a call, the background noise comes through. The epic noise cancelling present when listening to music is 100% disabled. Now, specifically, the feedback I gave Sony: I can see this as being a valid design decision. I can see some folks passionately arguing for them the way they are. I can also see folks passionately arguing for the way I prefer. Personally... I'm a rather mercurial fellow. I passionately want it the way they are some days. Other days I passionately want them the other way. THUS, I wrote Sony product support, and repeat hear (hoping they are reading/listening)... SONY... Please enable the functionality of \"Ambient Sound Control\" during calls AS WELL. Right now that is only available during playback or silence. That would take this headset from \"epic\" to \"legendary\". Not that there is anything wrong with \"epic\"... but really... don't you want to be \"legendary\"??? ;-) ;-)\n\n(Oh, and for those that do not have a set yet, get one, but what \"Ambient Sound Control\" does? It is a slider bar in the phone app that one one side is 100% noise cancellation, the other side 0%. Let's you allow some outside noise in. Also, it has an option to \"Focus on Voice\", to just let in the \"most common\" vocal pitches. Uncle Jerry's vacuum cleaner bass tone might still get blocked, and your mother in law's shrill tones might still get silenced, but the latter wouldn't be a loss. :-P)",

      "title": "READ: before you buy...",
      "body": "So I purchased this headphone because it was on sale on Amazon and because I read a lot of good reviews and articles about it.\n\nFirst off, it supports several bluetooth codecs such as SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and LDAC. From what I read, you get a (supposedly) superior sound quality (over bluetooth) if you configured your Sony WH-1000XM3 to use LDAC. LDAC is an audio coding technology developed by Sony that enables the transmission of High-Resolution (Hi-Res) Audio content, even over a Bluetooth connection. LDAC sound quality is supposed to be better than CD quality but to be honest, from my experience I cannot tell any sound quality difference between SBC codec (which is the basic coding standard for most Bluetooth devices and is present in almost in every device by default) and LDAC codec. In any case I opted to configure the headphone to use LDAC (just because) and tweak my smartphone to get the sound quality that I want.\n\nSo how does one do that? I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app for Android and set the following parameters.\n\"Sound Position Control\" = OFF.\n\"Surround (VPT)\" = OFF.\n\"Equalizer\" = OFF.\n\"Sound Quality Mode\" = PRIORITY ON SOUND QUALITY.\n\"DSEE HX\" = OFF.\n\nThen from my smartphone (Galaxy S7) and set the following parameters:\nSystem EQ to \"flat\".\nGo to Developer Options> set Bluetooth Audio Codec Streaming = LDAC.\nGo to Developer Options> set Bluetooth Audio Sample Rate = 96.0 kHz. I played some music from my Amazon Prime Music and the audio quality was flat (eventhough Sony claims LDAC was better). TO GET THE SOUND QUALITY I WANT FROM MY MUSIC, I have to adjust my smartphone system EQ (not the Sony app EQ since that can't be change when using LDAC or AptX). Or use SBC and adjust the Sony EQ until you achieved the sound quality to your liking.\n\nBottom line: By default the Sony WH-1000XM3 sound is a bit flat with a little bit of bass. Now you can change that by selecting a desired bluetooth codec and adjusting either your smartphone system EQ or the Sony app EQ. Which is really moot because one can argue that you can buy a less expensive headphone and tweak your smartphone to get the same result.\n\nALSO... if you ever use the headphone and pair it with your PC or any bluetooth devices, the EQ settings you configured to get that sound you like, is not saved in the headphone unless you use SBC codec.\n\nThe noise canceling is fantastic. It does not totally eliminates the noise but you can tell the difference, and you can drown out all the noise if you adjust your music up a little. I have not tested the audio call quality since I didn't buy the headphone for that purpose and I don't really talk on the phone that much.\n\nHope this helps.",

Beautiful looking- makes me look very good and color coordinated. See the smile breaking out on my face in the selfie. 😀😄😁. Color sits between tan and grey, not pure grey. See the contrast between my headphone, jacket and shirt. Takes phone calls; as long as I hear, myself, and others hear me over a call everything is fine.\n\nSound quality is the elephant in the room. I dismiss those who are looking for a flat balanced sound in every headphone, with strong bass that comes in only periodically. You all know where I am going. This is a SONY house sound. It is quite different, and reminded me of the experience walking into dance clubs with professional sound systems. Strong bass is always heard anywhere you walk in the dance club. Especially effective in cancelling external noise. You usually can't hear anything else in the club over the music. It is extremely energetic and opposite a laid back, relaxed sound. Volume is somewhat limited, but then again you do not want to put your ears next to the speakers in a club. Bluetooth is the equal of a wired connection, a rarity albeit with some reverb that adds to the house sound. This is a very EFFECTIVE headphone on all fronts.\n\nSONY made the XM4 to appease those looking for a more relaxed sound profile with comparative balance. In my opinion, this is moot, with extra noise cancelling that goes from excellent to most excellent. I understand that some love excess, over kill and to know they own the top dog. The law of diminished returns is my response. The XM3 is simply superb. Update: The XM3 has all of the advanced headphone bluetooth codecs, including low latency for movies and videos, within its default sound profile. The XM4 does not when it should for a higher price. The additional features it does offer are tangential; they do not relate to the core sound profile. Adding further support to my original opinion.",

      "title": "Overall Great Headphones, with a few minor annoyances",
      "body": "For a while prior to the purchase of these headphones, I really wanted a nice pair of Premium sounding NC Bluetooth Headphones. For the weeks prior to my tax refund check arriving, I debated the Sony Wh-1000mx3's and the Bose QC 35 ii's, I obviously went with the former of the two.\nThese arrived in a very timely manner, and the first thing I noticed out the gate was the immaculate and incredible presentation, huge shout out to Sony on that regard! After trying these headphones on I noticed how incredibly comfy they are, since owning them I have worn them for hours on end. Once I got the app setup through with, which was very easy and straightforward, I put these cans on, and man do they deliver! I listen to a lot of EDM, which consists of a lot of bass, and treble both that balance each other out. These headphones deliver in both departments. The bass is nice and punchy, with a good thundering sound to it, and the treble is crystal clear, with no distortion. I've also listened to other genres such as Rock, Pop, Rap, and a little bit of Country to try these out, and these sound incredible across the board! Another really awesome feature is the EQ, which is by no means a gimmick, as in other pairs of headphones/earbuds. Each individual preset in the EQ completely changes the sound, it's mind blowing!! The noise cancellation is also better than I was let to believe. Once you put these on, you are in your own world, surrounded by your favorite music. One of the first things I did when I got these headphones, was took them outside to test the cold weather glitch, because it was below freezing when I received these. If you're not familiar with the cold weather glitch, it's where the touch controls bug out in temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The issue was prevalent in the other reviews I read, and I can attest that my set did it as well, but it's only a minor annoyance in my case, and I can definitely live with it. The only other annoyance I noticed was that my model started creaking whenever flexing the headband to put them on, but this has not caused any structural issues in the 4 months that I've had them.\n\nOverall Pros/Cons\nPros:\nFantastic Sound\nSolid EQ\nExceptional Noise Cancellation\nLightweight, comfortable feel.\n\nCons:\nTouch controls malfunction in cold weather\nMay start creaking\n\nFinal Verdict:\nOverall these are a fantastic buy. I have been loving and enjoying them on day 1, I would 10/10 buy these again! I feel like these are worth every penny out of the $350 price tag, but if you can get them cheaper, then by all means go for it!!",

      "title": "Wow! Fantastic headphones! But missing USB-C Cable and crappy Sony support.",
      "body": "These headphones are very good and have by far the best audio fidelity and noise canceling of any NC headset I have ever owned, approaching (though still not quite reaching) that of professional studio headphones. And they are comfortable to wear for hours on end. The noise canceling is very effective, even on commercial flights. The bluetooth is very stable and I have experienced no audio quality or disconnect issues as I have with other bluetooth headphones and earbuds. And the battery lasts me a couple weeks and you can easily check battery levels by tapping the power button twice - battery level is reported via headphone audio.\nOne additional surprise was the great sound quality in both directions when making calls. I never could use my previous Bose and Sony NC headphones for phone calls. My job has me on several conference calls daily with most lasting 60 to 90 minutes and previous NC headphones would have poor audio quality with folks on the other end having difficulty hearing me, or the audio would cut out intermittently. Not so with Sony’s latest model. Audio in both directions is stable and FM DJ clear and strong. Instead of complaining they can’t hear me, I now get asked what headset I am using because the audio is noticeably better than others on the call.\nSo, with all those positive comments, why only 4 instead of 5 stars? Because Sony packaged them without the USB-C charging cable and would not provide the obvious remedy of shipping me one. I received the headphones the day of an evening cross-country flight. This is my first USB-C device so I had no cable to charge them and they arrived with no power. The manual and box both said the cable was included, and the headphone case even has a special pocket for it. The box arrived new, unopened from Amazon still wrapped in factory plastic, and Amazon was the seller and fulfiller. I could not even use my new headphones as I had no way to charge them and a long flight quickly approaching. I ended up buying a cable at the airport for way too much markup.\nI could have returned the headphones to Amazon and waited for another set, but that meant traveling without them for this trip. Having bought my own cable, I was still owed one and figured Sony would gladly send me the missing cable for my inconvenience. Manufacturers usually prefer handling issues this way versus a full retail return which is more costly for all involved. Sony’s response follows and is why this review has a 4 rather than 5 star rating.\n“We really wish we could help you. We at email support deal with basic troubleshooting steps. We request you to contact the Amazon support team. We are positive that they will help you.”\n\n2018-11-16 EDIT: I recently switched to an iphone without a headphone jack. When used over Bluetooth for conference calls, I do get frequent complaints that folks cannot hear me. Wired, these headphones are xcellent for conference calls. Over Bluetooth for conference calls they are, unfortunately, mediocre.",

      "title": "Not as good as the WH1000XM2",
      "body": "I've owned a number of pairs of Sony wireless headphones going all the way back to the MDRs. My WH 1000XM2s were my favorite headset of all time. Great sound, dependable, great battery life, almost never lost bluetooth connection, etc. Fantastic headset. But after two years they just died one day. Would no longer take a charge even though they showed as charging.\n\nAnyway... I decided to go ahead and get a new pair. I really didn't notice I was purchasing a newer model. The design is almost exactly the same with a few minor cosmetic changes, like the the usb input now has a bronze detailing instead of silver. NBD. They look a little more stylized and sleeker, but that's really it. (I always buy the black models.).\n\nThe sound and fit qualities are both still good. The newer model may even be a little better at sound cancelling. However there are very big differences with regards to the UX and performance that are making me really miss my XM2s. First, the touch interface on the new model is complete crap. It is buggy as hell. It is both over and under-responsive to your touch controls at the same time. There is a notable lag between you touching the outside of the earpad and the control being activated. This results in you having to tap a control two, three, four, five times before it responds. I used to use the touch controls exclusively on the XM2s. Now, I only use it to pause/unpause. And even then my typical experience runs something like, tap pad, wait, tap pad again, music pauses and then restarts, tap pad, nothing, tap pad, nothing, double tap pad, music stops. (rinse and repeat). It's horrible. It almost makes me long for the buttons on my old Sony MDRs, which by the way, are still going strong 5 years later!!\n\nAnother BIG issue is Sony changed the charging input from a normal micro-USB on the XM2 to an \"Gold-plated L-shaped stereo mini plug.\" What the hell is that?!?! I don't either. Does it make your headset charge faster? Not that I've noticed. Any particular advantages? Not that I can see. Any downsides? Hell-yes!!! The battery life on the XM2 was fantastic. I could go a week commuting on a single charge. And if I did run out of juice I could always find a micro-USB charging cable and charge up. Now with the XM3 if you run out of juice and you don't have a (presumably proprietary) \"gold-plated L-shaped stereo mini plug\" with you, you $300 headset is now a $300 paperweight!!! WTF? But don't worry... with each XM3 Sony gives you a charging cable... a 4-inch charging cable?!?! There must be real gold in those \"L-shaped stereo mini plugs\"!!! So... now if you run out of power you need to remember to carry around your 4-inch proprietary charging cable. (Like... what could possibly go wrong with carrying a tiny 4\" black cable that if you ever lose bricks your headset?) And what is with the 4\"? I used to be able to hang my XM2s off a hook on the side of my desk and use any number of 4', 5' or even 6' cords to let them hang and quietly charge. Now you either have to take up a valuable USB port on your laptop, or let your headphones dangle precariously halfway between the floor and the wall charger. Trash design.\n\nIf you can find a refurb XM2 you'll save money and get a better product with only marginally worse noise cancelation.",

      "title": "Basically a lighter, simpler version of the original MDR-1000x model",
      "body": "I owned the 1st version of these headphones (MDR-1000x) ever since Sony launched their noise-cancelling line in 2016, and used them almost on a daily basis everywhere. I traveled a lot so they were great on flights, and great for office use and gaming as well. However 3 years later, one of the arms broke (I was able to fix it with Scotch tape which worked for about a year). Apparently this is a common issue for people who've owned this headset for a few years, which I really hope Sony has fixed in their 3rd gen device.\n\nAnyway I got 4 years of almost daily use/abuse out of that headset, and have recently purchased this WH1000XM3 model as replacement. My impressions after almost 2 months of use:\n\n- It's lighter and feels more balanced than the original. The original definitely had more weight in the cups.\n- Battery life feels shorter. The 1st gen could last me 2 days of nonstop playback, this model definitely doesn't match that. I guess that's the trade-off for making this thing lighter.\n- Gone is the 3rd button. They combined the noise cancelling on/off button with the ambient sound button, which I have mixed feelings about.\n- Gone is the Voice mode for ambient sound. The 1st gen allowed you to set it so only higher frequencies (in the speech range) would pass through, which I found useful in settings where you want to tune out most distractions but need to be able to hear if someone's calling for your attention. This I am a little disappointed about.\n- Gone are the dedicated NC & Ambient Mode indicator LEDs. The only remaining LED is the power indicator, which flashes blue once every 5 seconds, rather than a stable blue while the device is on. Overall it's a lot harder to determine the status of these headphones if you left them sitting on the desk which is annoying but not a deal-breaker.\n- USB-C is a nice upgrade.\n\nAnyway I still give 5 stars because while Sony did take away a few things I found useful, they did make it lighter and more comfortable which I appreciate. I really hope they constructed the arms out of a less brittle plastic this time though.",

      "body": "This review will be most helpful for those who are comparing the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II's with the Sony WH1000XM3's.\n\nI ordered the Bose QC 35 II's as an early Christmas gift to myself (December 2018). I've owned and loved my Bose QC 20 noise cancelling earbuds and was expecting nothing less from the more expensive flagship model. In deciding between the Sony's and the Bose, it helped that Bose dropped their price to $299 for the holidays.\n\nThe Bose QC's were extremely disappointing right out of the box. I followed all of the directions to the letter and downloaded the app. The noise cancellation was sub-par at best but I was dreading a lengthy return and stuck with them for another couple of days. The active noise cancellation never improved. I could hear an entire conversation happening next to me even with noise cancellation on at it's highest setting and music playing. These weren't even as good as my old Bose QC earbuds!!\n\nBefore returning them, I did some research and discovered that many, many, people were having issues with the QC 35 II's newest firmware update. Just Google it, the info is readily available. The most common complaint was degraded noise cancellation after upgrading the firmware. It was reported that there were no patches and no relief even if you installed an earlier firmware to your headphones. That was the last straw and I decided I had to go with the Sony's even if they were a little more expensive.\n\nAmazon gets major points for making the return process unbelievably easy and quick. (They processed the refund for Amazon credit before they even received the headphones back.)\n\n------------\nThese headphones are an absolute dream. The active noise cancellation destroy the Bose by a healthy margin. They are both comfortable and light and the sound quality (to my ears) is also superior to the Bose. If you are looking for an experience that makes the world around you \"drop away\" then this is the pair for you. Battery life is excellent and being able to fast charge with USB-C aka your laptop charger is a game changer.\n\nI was worried about call quality and the fact that you can't hook up two devices at once. I can report that the call quality is just average but wasn't a major deal breaker for me. The device switching issue is a flaw that I hope they will address in subsequent models. The reality is that it takes about 1 minute extra to switch between your laptop and phone. It's annoying but mainly a first world problem.\n\nAnd no, the model I received doesn't feel like the band is going to crack. I would pay the $11 to get insurance, though, just in case.",

I like every single thing about them.\n\nLooks:\nThey are asthetically appealing. Not too bulky not to slim, not tin can looking, or anything. Nothing I can say to the negative here.\n\nComfort:\nEar cup padding is soft and comfortable. It seems durable, but only time will tell with that. Light weight on your head, but just heavy enough to feel like they won't fly away in a heavy wind.\n\nSound quality:\nSo far I've: listened to heavy bass, smooth jaz'ish, Transformers movie, Headphone test on youtube. Excellent Quality\n21Hz (just 1Hz above the lower limit of human hearing, so that's probably due to my own hearling loss)\n15000Hz (Abount 4000 Hz below the upper limit of human hearing, so probably due to the same thing)\nNO buzzing through the range of bass frequencies. Excellent quality sound\nOnly MINIMAL deviation between right and left balance when dynamically increasing and decreasing pitch of the drivers. Excellent quality sound\n\nNoise Cancellation and Ambienty sound:\nNoise cancellation is EXCELLENT. I put the head phones on my head, and turned them on. As soon as they were completely powered up, the TV went ABSOLUTELY SILENT. I had to lift the ear cups away from my head to verify the TV was still on.\nWhen the ambient sound is on, I can hear my TV at the same level it was at when I first turned them on, but the sound of the TV is a little muffled... as I'd expect with closed-back headphones. Only open-back headphones will pass more or less the same volume of ambient sound.\nNoise cancellation and Ambient sound quality EXCELLENT.\n\nSummary.\nThese are excellent quality headphones, with excellent control of the noise and the ambient sound. The quality of the sound reproduction when listening to music or watching a movie is outstanding.

And these headphones just sit right on my head, super lightweight and doesn't squeeze... yet the noise cancellation feature is truly amazing, because I can't head a darn thing outside of these headphones.\nAt one point today I actually searched all of my downstairs for my phone for probably close to 15min because I told myself there is no way the bluetooth can be perfectly stable all over my bottom floor with my phone upstairs. Turns out, I was wrong. My phone was in my room the whole time... now that's impressive.\nAnd as far as the sound quality goes... just top notch. I'm certainly not an audiophile, but I'm a videographer by trade and I can definitely appreciate good quality audio. And the app has a full eq tab with presets and manual control, so you can adjust the sound however you like. I personally found the \"bright\" preset with the bass turned back up to 0 to work best for me.\nBuild quality, again.. top notch... just feels good.\n\nCouple things:\n-The push one finger to the touch pad to operate my phone assistant feature isn't working, not sure if its just a defect. But you can make the NC/ambient button do that instead. And if I were to want to turn the noise cancellation off for any reason, I'd rather use the app to adjust the amount for the situation anyways.\n-The bluetooth disconnected once when I laid on my phone in my pocket.\n-Can't really headbang either since I think its the air pressure sensor sounds kinda funny when the phones shift around on you ear. But you're also wearing lightweight headphones so you can't really headbang anyways.. ha\n-Also I kinda wish the touch pad was on the left ear, rather than the right. Personal preference there, just a comfort thing. But I'm sure I'll get used to it on the right.\n\nAlso, I must note, I am a heavy review reader... but rarely do I ever actually write my own.\nEitherway, If you have almost 300 to drop on headphones, you'll love these.",

I have been wanting to buy these since they were released but already had a good set of Bose QC 35 headphones and just couldn't justify the cost. With the huge discount offered on the Treasure Truck deal I couldn't resist!\n\nFirst the good: These are very comfortable and feel high end all around. Great case, quality materials, soft touch and easy to use controls. The noise cancellation is as good as if not better than Bose. These are solid high end contenders in the premium noise cancelling category. I love the gesture based controls and unlike others have had zero issue using them.\n\nHere are the quibbles. Let's start with an issue that's inherent with over the ear headphones and that's that though these fit well and are comfortable they do get pretty warm with extended use. Definitely not suitable with warmer weather. The second issue is bigger and one that needs to be considered.\n\nThe sound balance (to me) is not ideal. The headphones have an over pronounced mid-bass that makes just about everything sound very muddy if not addressed via the EQ settings which would be fine if not for the last issue.\n\nYou cannot change the EQ via the Sony app without also using the lowest Bluetooth codec. Adjusting the in app EQ automatically changes the default sound to optimize connection, which all but forces the codec to SBC. I bought these in order to finally be able to access Sony's LDAC codec! The workaround for this is to adjust the EQ for all sound via your phone's overall sound settings. Once this has been done the headphones sound amazing but then you cannot use any other headphones without again adjusting the phone's EQ, definitely NOT ideal. Turning off noise cancellation also helps substantially but that's not ideal either.\n\nOverall would I recommend these? Yes, they really are very well engineered headphones but Sony either needs to address the default sound or work around the app limitation for these to be great.",

      "body": "I've just switched to these from some Bose SoundLink headphones; the Sonys are more comfortable, sleek, and solidly-built. The noise cancelling is excellent, it's like turning turning the world off. I've experienced a \"pressure\" in my ears with other models of active-cancelling headphones, but with these it's barely perceptible.\n\nI have two complaints:\n\n1) Unlike the SoundLink headphones (which are two years old), these cannot connect to multiple devices at once. I used to be able to pair my headphones to my computer and phone simultaneously, and if a call came in, or if I started playing music on one of them, I wouldn't have to do anything special— the audio from both would just be mixed together. That is NOT the case here; you must disconnect from one device and connect to the other to switch the audio source.\n\nSupposedly there is a tricky way to pair only the phone connection from one device and the audio from the other, but this doesn't cut it for me. They should just work; I should be able to simply pair and connect to two devices and not worry about it; no limitations. This is a pretty glaring issue for a modern, top-of-the line set of headphones.\n\n2) The UI is very annoying to use. My older headphones had a simple physical switch to turn them on and off; it would take only a fraction of a second for me to pick up/put down my headphones. With these, you have to hold down the power button for three whole seconds to turn them on or off. This gets very annoying very quickly. A simple switch would be much faster and much better user experience.\n\nSame problem with the noise cancelling control— there are three modes: Active cancelling, ambient sound, and off. It takes about four seconds to toggle between *each* of the three modes. You push the mode button, there's a full half-second delay after your button press before the push-tone responds, then the automated voice slowly speaks the current mode, and then a second after it finishes speaking the mode actually switches. Again, a simple three-way physical switch would be so much faster and better user experience.\n\nOverall, these are a step up from my previous Bose experience, but I had to give up a big chunk of convenience for the better comfort and quality.",

      "title": "Great noise cancellation; mediocre sound quality",
      "body": "The WH10000XM3's noise suppression is excellent, almost entirely eliminating the sound of a nearby air conditioner, yet allowing the sound of a microwave timing out or a phone ringing to get through at somewhat reduced volume. My previous noise suppression solutions were passive - Etymotic ER4P's, Fnova 34 dB ear muffs, or MAX-30 foam earplugs. These Sony's are much quieter than the Etymotics and foam earplugs, and almost as good as the Fnova ear muffs. They Sony's are also suitable for listening to a TV, podcast, casual background music or similar audio source where sound reproduction precision is not critical.\n\nHowever the sound quality of Sony WH1000XM3 over Bluetooth (even with aptX HD) is mediocre compared to my wired headphones (Etymotics ER4P's, Sony MDR-V6 and Sony MDR-7506). I would rate all these wired alternatives as excellent, even though the Ety's vs. wired Sony's have quite different responses. In comparison to these wired headphones, the WH1000XM3 has too much bass and too little treble, and the sound quality is muddy, including poor location and poor clarity of sound reproduction.\n\nThe Sony WH1000XM3's have a wired option that lets you connect to a sound source through a provided cable, which improves the sound quality significantly, but it still falls noticeably short of the Etymotic ER4P's and Sony MDR-V6's and MDR-7506's. The over-heavy bass, too little treble, muddiness, poor location and lack of reproduction clarity are still there, but are significantly improved over the quality of using them in Bluetooth mode.\n\nSo if you are looking for great noise cancellation and wireless convenience, and are willing to live with mediocre music quality, the WH1000XM3 is a great product. If you want an fantastic musical experience and are willing to live with a wired solution, I suggest trying the Etymotic ER4P, ER4XR or ER4SR (all small in-ear headphones), or (the much less expensive) Sony MDR-V6 or MDR-7506.\n\nOne other thing - if you are at the limits of distance with the WH1000MX3's, like some (or all?) Bluetooth headphones the WH1000MX3's make a sound like annoyingly loud popcorn popping - I don't understand why noise cancelling headphones couldn't filter these pops out by detecting the Bluetooth link was temporarily lost.",

      "body": "These are my first pair of noise cancellation head phones. They are simply amazing. But not having a plethora of experience with other heasphones of this type it's hard to gauge just how awesome these are. I watched MKBHD's review on these and the Bose 700s. He still stuck with these as his daily driver. A co-worker has a pair of these so I got to try them out. I love them. A surprising plus was how compact the case was on these. It's small enough where I'll probably actually use the case and not just toss them somewhere.\n--I week follow up: Still in love. Only issue's I've had was quality loss on my PC at work (linux) and that's because it's using the SBC Codec. Once I get it working with LDAC I'm expecting the quality to come back. I use these all day at work and then at home. When I'm going to bed I plug them in. They generally have 40% battery at that time.\n--1 month+: Fixed the codec issues at work. I use these for hours literally every day. On a long day I'm usually getting low batter messages maybe an hour before bedtime. I still use the Case every day. It's pretty convienent.\nMy only gripe with these is I wish it was easier to tell Left from Right. There's a small L and R with the R being red. But in a dark room (spend most of my computing hours with the lights off) it can be hard to tell which orientation they're in when picking them back up. The Bose 700s have a large L and R printed on the speaker foam in the ear can which seems like it might be a better option.\nFor now I suppose a thin strip of tape on the right side will have to do.\n-- 6 month: I've gotten used to the Left Right issue. No longer a complaint. Battery life is still amazing. Audio quality is still amazing. If these broke tomorrow I'd likely buy another pair instantly. Great product!\n\n-- FOUR AND A HALF YEARS LATER\nThe bonded leather ear pads have long since worn off. But they're still comfortable.\nI am only posting this edit because they are finally starting to have issues with Bluetooth connectivity, getting the Mic to work, etc.\nI've been having to reset the firmware somewhat frequently to get it to connect.\n\nI have zero complaints. I have literally been using these 10+ hours a day for the past 4+ years.\nI more than got my money's worth out of them.",

      "body": "I've went through 9 or 10 pairs of over-ear and a dozen pairs of tws earbuds over the past two years. I've learned how I like my audio to sound, how noise cancelling works, and have tried hard to find a reasonable balance between price and performance.\n\nI've realized that even though the more budget friendly section of bluetooth headphones has taken massive leaps forward, there's simply no substitute for proven, \"premium\" brands. And Sony's WH-1000xM3 indeed still lead the way in the wireless world.\n\nIf you're like me, and have been contemplating biting the bullet for these because of the newer model (xM4's), I honestly believe that 95% of people wouldn't have a clue as to the differences between them. The xM3's sound awesome with most of all genres, bass is really punchy, but refined in a way budget headphones just can't compete with. It's hard to explain, but if I had to try, I would say that these make the music feel deeper and \"immersive\", almost like you're in the recording studio with the band, but weren't allowed to open your eyes, if that makes any sense. Lol.\n\nMy head is on the upper side of large, but they still fit perfectly, and the seal they make is something I haven't gotten from literally any other headphones I've tried. Some might say that because they are made of mostly plastic, that it makes them seem cheap and thus more likely to break. Since I've had them, I've accidentally sat on them, directly onto the arm while it was fully extended... And they were totally fine. I also had them on as I was riding a bike when I turned my head in a way that caused my jacket hood to knock them off and landing on the pavement. I was relieved when the only thing that happened was a little scratch on the outer ear cup that can barely be seen.\n\nTo sum up my thoughts, I would recommend anyone who is open and willing to paying more for headphones, and are looking for that upper tier noise cancelling, then look no further.",

      "body": "I usually wait a year before writing a review but these warranted an early one. These went beyond my expectations. After doing a lot of research and having a lot of conversations with my wallet, I decided to go ahead and buy them. Originally it was only for the noise canceling (which is amazing, it blocks out / lowers any sound greatly that I might hear, and with any audio playing, I hear virtually nothing around me.) but the sound quality is better than expected - with the noise cancellation. Going from using some $30 Bluetooth earbuds (Tranya T3) to these, the quality of the connection is much better, no cutouts, and of course, battery life is a godsend. While they both have similar sound quality to me, the features you get with these XM3's makes it so much more worth the price. I can use them all day without worrying about having to charge. Then again, for $350 these better be better than my previous pair!\n\nI'm very impressed with the build quality. I wear them all day and they don't get uncomfortable at all, even while wearing glasses.\n\nWhat really impressed me with these is the touch controls. Double-tap to play/pause, swipe up/down for volume, and swipe forward/backward for next or previous track. I never knew I wanted controls like this until I got them.\n\nSound quality almost threw me for a loop though. The sound quality out of the box is decent and didn't really sound full to me. Although, once I used the Headphones Connect app and started playing around with the equalizer I was able to make them sound much better.\n\nI use these primarily on my laptop and at first thought, those settings couldn't transfer over to my laptop, but what you have to do is turn on Bluetooth on your phone and just connect the headphones through the app, not to your phone directly. Even when you turn Bluetooth off on your phone, the settings will stay configured on the headphones.\n\nAll in all, these are now my favorite headphones. The battery life allows me to use them all day and I use them for everything; music, TV, gaming, etc. I don't regret the purchase one bit.",

      "body": "** FOUR YEAR UPDATE **\nThe headphones are still in amazing shape dispite being thrown in my backpack (in the case) and being lugged across my college campus every day. I still love these headphones and everything below is still true.\n\n*Original review*\nThis is a bit long but it's very detailed.\n\nThese headphones are amazing. If that's not convincing enough, they're well worth the price, too. I listen to music every day, and these have the wonderful sound quality I was looking for. They sound great out of the box, but if you spend a few minutes in the optional (but highly recommended) companion app, you can tailor the sound to your liking for an unmatched experience. The noise cancelation is phenomenal. It won't block out voices, but it's not meant to. It blocks road noise out perfectly. Extremely comfortable too. I have a large head and I can wear these for a full day without fatigue.\n\nThis headset is wireless and can be used with the included cable if desired. The headphones also include the NFC Pairing feature. You can just tap your phone flat on the left ear cup and it will pair automatically. The touch control on the right ear cup is a bit hard at the start, but once you get used to it, it's hard to live without. And the headphones also have a feature where you can cover the right ear cup with your hand and it let's outside noise in. It works very smoothly and very quickly.\n\nThese headphones are very versatile when it comes to types of music. With a few adjustments in the app, they can go from shimmering classical to loud metal to powerful hip hop. The app let's you adjust every characteristic of the sound you could possibly want. On the physical side of things, they're made of plastic with a soft touch type texture. They don't scratch easily though. They're very flexible and the ear cups are extremely soft, but not so soft they collapse onto your ears. They come in a carrying case that is one of the best I've seen. It is very small and can fit everything you need. I even fit a charging brick in the pocket inside.\n\nIf you have the money and are serious about buying these, don't talk yourself out of it. I couldn't recommend these any more. I have let a dozen or so people try these with varying genres of music and they all agreed with everything I've said. I would buy these again if they got lost or broke, but these are so durable I don't see that being an issue.",

I needed a headphone that could isolate my piano music from the TV... These do the job better than sound isolating headphones like DirectSound ex29 - which I also own... I *can* hear the TV, it's just so minimized so as to not be a bother.\nI use these headphones wired with the digital piano.\n\nThe headphones work wired or bluetooth ... and in wired mode, can work passively.\nThe sound quality suffers radically when they are unpowered - I don't use them that way... I'd consider that an emergency feature, so you'll never be without sound.\n\nThey work fine as a telephone headset. Not great, not bad. I hear fine, and never have had a complaint about my voice, but I'd say apple AirPods make the person speaking sound clearer. But not bad.\n\nI like that you can adjust the amount and kind of noise cancelation you'd like ... I usually use them with it 100% on, but if you want ambient sound to be let in, you can do that ...\n\nI like the double-tap the right cup to pause/play music\n\nI find the on/off button a bit more difficult to use than the Bose switch... you have to press and hold the button on these - and it's not that easy to find, because there are two buttons... (the other is for the ambient sound mode).\n\nI'd rather have a physical on-off switch rather than a press-to-hold button\n\nThe performance of these phones are great - I'm enormously satisfied.\n\nThe comfort is better than okay - and worse than great. I think my Bose QC-15's are a bit more comfortable - not because they are softer, these are similarly soft, but because these get a bit hot. I thought they got too hot the first couple of times I used them, then I was no longer bothered ... I did buy cloth covers for the pads - (but since I got used to the phones, I stopped using the covers.). So... hot enough that I thought I needed covers, but good enough that I don't use them... if that makes sense.\n\nOverall, I'm very very pleased",

      "body": "This is my second pair of WH1000X Sony headphones. My prior pair, the M2, were stolen. I think I can say that the quality of this headphone is likely why they were stolen - besides the fact, it is never good to leave such a fine looking headphone in plain sight in your car. Smash and Grab. They knew what they were getting.\nAt any rate, I immediately purchased a replacement pair - except these are the WH1000XM3. There was not second thinking on the replacement.\nThe WH1000XM3 improved sound over the M2. More comfortable, better Noise Reduction, as well as a few new whistles and bells, such as voice recognition over background that pauses my music when I begin talking to someone. Not exactly necessary, but a nice touch. Someone said that they were disappointed that to turn level up/down, they had to repeatedly touch the right earpiece. While that is a way to increase/decrease level, the touch and hold feature does work well also. Touch the earpiece and slide your finger to the top and hold. The level automatically continues to increase until you remove the finger. Same for decrease.\nThe sound quality is again a leaping improvement over the M2. Richer bass, crisper highs. Noticeable greater sound quality over my other headphones. And the Noise Cancellation - - I didn't think they could improve on that, however, they certainly did. Having had other N/C headphones including the Sony predecessor to these, I have been able to easily compare the sound and N/C characteristics. These are phenomenal headphones. The price is totally acceptable for what you are getting. Didn't even think twice about going with a cheaper pair. The WH1000XM3 are luxurious, smooth operating, and great sound. Did I mention, my favorite genre of music is Classical Cathedral vocals, and orchestras, by which sound quality if really tested and clearly revealed through the headphones. These Sony WIN!!",

They really are great sounding headphones. They also have better bluetooth range than my other headphones (Skull Candy HESH 2 wireless).\n\nBelow are a couple of bugs / annoyances. Please note that before writing this review, I verified the firmware is up to date via the Sony Headphones app and that these issues still occur as of writing.\n\n-- Touch Volume and play controls:\nThis is by for the most annoying part of this product. The media controls are a \"touch area\" on the side of the headset (like a track pad). Slide your finger up or down for volume and forward/back for next/previous. I believe that about 80% of the time it gets it right, but there are so many times when I want to turn up the volume on a movie or an audio track, and it goes to the next track/episode instead. I just started using the phone/iPad controls instead.\n\nI've also had issues with it sometimes not detecting a swipe at all, requiring multiple tries.\n\nI really wished I checked out the competition instead for the above reasons alone.\n\n-- Switching previously paired devices\nThese headphones often have issues changing devices. For example, I'll change from my iPhone to my iPad. I'll click the headphones in the other device's bluetooth settings, power on the head phones and then I'll hear \"connected\" twice. The headphones will connect to the new device and then change to the previous device. Sometimes trying again will work, but the work around is to turn off bluetooth on the other device.\n\nIn comparison, my Skull Candy and MPOW bluetooth headphones don't have this issue.\n\n-- Auto Power Off issues:\nedit: the headphones do not have auto power off. There is an option to auto power off if Bluetooth is disconnected.\n\nEvery time I forgot to turn them off before bed, they would still be on in the morning.\n\nThis is a bit of an issue since even with no audio, the noise cancelling functionality is active and uses the battery.",

      "body": "in two words--clumsy and annoying.\n\ni have been a bose user for about ten years. out of the box, i charge them, turn them on, and then just use them. very easy and functional. btws--NONE of the following issues apply to bose functionality and ANC.\n\ni decided to try the sony's because it is reviewed as being more convenient and having better ANC--but it doesn't, on both. (1) it took several web searches to figure out how to connect and turn on/off the headphones. from other reviews i knew that i had to download an app, but i didn't realize that they always have to be connected to some device; that took a week to realize because initially i was using them to listen to Kant on audiobook. also, i realized that i can't charge them and use them at the same time. i couldn't even have the headphones charging while it did the first update because it would automatically disconnect from my phone and cancel the update; that took hours to realize. not connecting to both laptop and phone simultaneously is actually more of an issue than i thought it would be. (2) regarding ANC, if it is better, then it is too marginal for me to notice. because of this, there is no compensation/oiff-set for the more awkward functionalities. for example, having to connect to a device for the ANC to work is a real deal breaker. i use the headphones primarily for ANC, and the majority of the time, I am not listening to anything. so i don't need it to be connected to anything. i have security concerns about just having my bluetooth on all time. it's usually on only on when i am actively actually using it (i.e., listening to an audiobook). i am fairly unhappy with realizing that they must be connected all the time to prevent them from turning off. the auto off feature is apparently impossible to deactivate, which makes the value of the headphones to me quite low. i did a search and found a sony page that indicates that i can just select turn auto off off, but that is not an option. i searched through the app and found no such option. so the time i am wasting and the loss of focus from the work i need to be doing to just learn how to use and cope with these headphones makes them annoying to me.\n\ni do appreciate some off the more superficial differences between these and the bose. they look better. the headband seems smaller; so it fits my small head better. the ear cups are smaller; so they also fit my ears better. the touch sensor controls make starting and stopping easier; and i don't have to remove them every time a person tries to talk to me or my frenchie. however, i dislike the hollow tap sounds in my ear every time i have to click it on/off. i dislike how loud the voice and the beeps are. they can't be good for my ears. i've tried gently tapping, but the noise occurs.\n\nso i didn't give them a 1 star (relative to bose) because of some of these little things, which i do appreciate about them. i'm not sure i would buy them again, if i had a do over. i kinda regret spending the money to buy them.",

      "title": "Noise cancellation is great, but only 4 starts due to a collection of minor stuff",
      "body": "These have been a surprisingly massive upgrade in terms of the effectiveness of the noise cancellation. Most semi-consistent sounds simply disappear a few seconds after power-on. The effectiveness does vary slightly depending on conditions, but you can generally adjust out this variance using the free app to adjust. Perhaps the best example is that the characteristics of air pressure and such vary by altitude, so the right formula for noise cancellation is a little different at 35,000' than it was on the ground - you can use the app to sense the needed adjustment and make it.\n\nWhile the actual noise cancellation is fantastic, there are a series of small items that collectively make it seem a bit short of a true 5-star item:\n\n1). The app is clunky, and, for me at least, is currently entirely broken (even with a re-install). It usually gets the job done, but it really could benefit from some usability work, and the recent issue with it locking up after the \"accept newe terms\" page has made it useless until the next update.\n2). The case is mostly solid, but the slots for putting in cables can be a bit challenging. There is a clear fit for the airplane adaptor slot, but the headphones and charging cables do not fit as neatly in as I would expect for this level of product.\n3) If you unplug the physical cable from the headphones, it automatically turns off. I have not been able to find a way to disable this, and just because I stop being plugged into something doesn't mean I want to lose the sound cancelation vs. my current environment or that I'm not wanting to simply switch to using my Bluetooth device. The result is that I pull the cable, wait for it to power down, and then have to press and hold the power button to get it turned back on followed by the brief delay before the actual noise cancelation begins anew.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase. Were I to do it again, I would probably go for the QC35's from Bose simply because they fit me just slightly better, but I don't have any real regrets.",

I've heard some people say there's too much mid... well the app solves that with the built in EQ\n- Buttons on the left side (power, optimizer, ANC on/off etc) are intuitive and easy to use once you get the hang of it\n- Microphone sounds good enough, doesn't pick up a ton of ambient noise like other wireless cans. I will say I don't really take calls with these because the isolation even with ANC off is almost too good. You can't really hear yourself talk, it just feels awkward\n- Build quality and the case are solid. I feel confident tossing them in my backpack while in the case, it's pretty rigid.\n\nCons\n- I wish the bluetooth range was better. It goes about 30' while other models go 100'-300'. I work from home and got these so I can pace around the house while on calls, which are typically taken from software on my computer not my phone\n- The touch controls on the right can are basically useless. They never respond as I expect them to. I wish I could deactivate them because if I have a hood on, they'll randomly change volume, songs etc... but when I want to use them exactly as the instructions say, they don't respond.\n\nOverall, I'd say 7/10. The ANC and sound quality are what matters and those are 10/10 for the price. I would buy these again, though if these break I may wait to see if they release a new model that hopefully addresses my complaints.",

      "body": "I purchased all three of these headphones because I couldn't decide which ones would be best for me.\n\nBottom line is, if you are looking for multi-purpose, noise-canceling headphones for the office, the Sony WH1000MX3 are NOT the headphones for you; but if you are are an audiophile who is mostly going to listen to music and just wants the convenience of being able to answer calls at the same time, then these are the BEST for you.\n\nNone of the three headphones do a good job of blocking out higher-pitched sounds like human voices, which was a big disappointment for me as that is a critical need in my new employers large \"open office\" setup. And the Sonys were the worst of the three. But all three do a great job of blocking out lower-pitched noise like fans, motors, etc.\n\nListening to music on the Sonys is phenomenal, and that's just using its default equalizer settings. It's rich, detailed, crisp sound that makes you feel like you are in the middle of a first class concert hall performance. There's no comparison between them and the other two, and I'm not even an audiophile. If that's your primary purpose, rest assured these are the headphones for you.\n\nAs an office headphone, though, they are lacking. You cannot connect to a computer, only your cellphone. As of this time, they don't use Siri, only Google Assistant and Alexa (I suspect Sony will fix that in a future firmware update). They don't block or even muffle human voices; of anything they made nearby conversations even clearer which makes them more distracting. The feature I was most excited about -- the hand-over-muff to pause music and \"hear through\" to ambient sounds -- turned out not to be all that helpful. As a right-hander, it ties up my right hand the entire time so I can't take notes on whatever I'm being told. Plus, people just seem to need me to move my headphones off my ear for them to believe I'm listening.\n\nThe Sony headphones look fairly high-end on the outer surfaces, but they feel cheaply made, especially inside the ear cups and the headband. The ear cups get hot much more quickly than the other two brands (compared all with music and ANC running). Instead of matching the cord colors to the beige-gold headset (or even using a standard white or cream cords), they are black which adds the the chintzy feel (for $350 you kinda expect more attention to detail).\n\nThe Sonys do have the best-designed case of all three. Compact, solidly built, has a built-in divider for the cords, has both a handle strap and an outer mesh slip pocket. Unfortunately it is covered in a cheap-looking tweedy fabric that grabs and holds onto dirt, dog hair, etc. if you get the \"beige gold\" headphones like I did, the fabric is a super ugly, chintzy-looking beige tweed that will look dirty within a couple of days.\n\nIn the end, the Jabras were the best suited for my needs because of their better noise cancelling of voices; Siri integration; ability to pair simultaneously with a phone and my laptop (note: the Jabras aren't designed to pair with laptops but I got them to by tweaking a few Windows 10 settings -- see my Jabra review for details); and clever convenience features like auto-pause music when removed from the ears and power on/off by simply swiveling the ear cups.",

I work in an open office setting (i.e. I would like to sometimes listen to music well there too). At home I much prefer to use speakers, but once in a while I like to listen to music on my headset at home too.\n\nFor my bday this year I figured why not...let me get myself a new headset. I checked out a few, read many of their reviews (both on Amazon, YouTube, and other sites such as Cnet etc) and finally decided to get these even though I found them to be quite a bit more over what I would normally want to pay for a headset.\n\nBut it's been worth every single penny. The connectivity is top notch, and the quality of the sound...wow! Great bass, crisp vocals...this is just an all round amazing headset! I've always believed that noise cancellation headsets were primarily designed to filter out certain constant sounds, typically the sounds of jet engines while on a plane. For that setting this headset is fantastic. Even outside of being on a plane, this headset has been doing the best with noise cancellation. This headset is also hands down the most comfortable headset I've ever used. It's also hands down the most expensive headset I've ever owned...but I honestly don't mind having shelled out all that $$$ one bit...I'm so glad I got this for myself as a bday gift this year!\n\nThe package comes with a great case...for someone like me who loves traveling it's perfect! The case is also perfect for carrying the headset to/fro from work in my backpack. And of course in general when not in use, I store the headset in the provided case. The package also comes with wires to charge and use for a wired connection (as opposed to a Bluetooth connection).\n\nAll in all, I would absolutely recommend this headset to anyone in a heartbeat. Well done Sony, well done!",

      "body": "Background: I've had these since Nov'18, and I constantly use these headphones. I have 7000~9000 hours using these headphones.\n\nPros:\n-> Active Noise Cancellation is great.\n-> Audio quality is great.\n-> Comfortable wearing for long periods. I've worn it for thousands of hours so far with no issues.\n-> Doesn't have a strong air-pressure change when putting them on or removing them. My old Bose QC25 were pretty harsh on my eardrums.\n-> Battery charges very quickly with the right charger. USB-C 30W charger just pours energy in.\n-> Battery lasts for 20-35 hours wired. I don't use the Bluetooth enough to know how long it lasts.\n-> Almost no static noise. I have painfully sensitive hearing, and in a truly quiet environment the static audio outputted by these is nearly non-existent (compared to Bose QC25).\n-> ANC on an Airplane works super well. It greatly helps relieve the pressure changes in the cab and the relentless noise of passengers / wind.\n\nCons:\n-> The ear-pads can absorb moisture, and dry slowly. Don't let them get wet with sweat or water.\n-> Temperateure changes sometimes trigger the bluetooth assistant. This was supposed to be fixed from a firmware upgrade but still persists for my set. I think it's a hardware issue.\n-> Battery does not degrade linearally. Mine drops from 100-60 in around 2 hours, then stays on 30-20 for ~4-6 hours. Not a super big deal for me, but noteworthy.\n-> Gesture controls are kinda iffy. I like the button-free usage but they don't always work the way I want. In addition sometimes I set a gesture simply readjusting the headphones.\n\nOverall:\nA great pair of Headphones. I have recommended to friends and family simply pointing to the audio quality and ANC of this pair. I've used it on Airplanes and it truly makes a great difference.",

      "body": "I have been using these every day since I received them (April 10, 2020). They hardly ever leave my ears. I can't believe that I've lived this long without this technology. My apartment neighbors are amazingly loud (hitting walls, yelling at each other, moving furniture, etc) and now have a baby that screams most of its existence to make it worse.\n\nI'll admit that I've never had noise cancelling or wireless, bluetooth headphones before, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. I've researched these and the comparable Bose pair. Many Youtube videos were watched before the reluctant purchase.\n\n+The sound quality seems way better than other (wired) over-the-ears pairs I have (Hyper X Cloud X, AKG M80 MKII, Sennheiser HD 518).\n\n+It seems to block sound pretty well, quiet enough that I have to set timers on my phone while I'm listening to music, because I will not hear the dryer or stove timers go off.\n\n+USB-C was a great choice for charging cable (in my case), because that's what I use for my Android phone and it seems to charge fast, considering how long they last between chargings.\n\n+I like that I can plug in an audio cable (3.5mm Male to Male) directly from my PC or other device without having to use bluetooth. So, it is not wireless only. They have to be on to use noise cancelling.\n\n+ They seem pretty strong. I fell asleep with them on and I didn't break them. I'm not going to intentionally try to break them to test that theory, though.\n\n+I've not had any complaints with people I've talked to on the phone when using them. One person said I kind of sounded like I was \"in a bubble\", but very clear. I've talked for over an hour with no issues on my end.\n\n-The distance from the device (phone or TV) seems a bit short (less than 20 ft or so) before it starts losing it or cutting off, but that may just be a limitation of the technology in general.",

      "body": "These are great headphones! I've been searching for a pair for quite a while. Came across these that were at the top of many review lists, and I agree - these are the best. In no particular order, here are my findings:\n1. They're nicely padded and comfortable and my ears don't get hot or feel pressed even after wearing for a few hours when streaming shows or gaming. the ear cups alone cut down a lot of the external noise.\n2. the battery lasts forever and it's great that its rechargeable through a USB-C adapter (which is Super fast at recharging).\n3. the sound quality is very impressive. sure, it isn't body shaking like a home theater is, but it can certainly fill your ears with the whole range, including great bass.\n4. the noise canceling is great. it immediately sounds like you've stepped into one of those sensory deprivation rooms. Of course you'll still hear the occasional loud noise or if you're next to someone trying to talk to someone you can hear them but it is very reduced. keep in mind you wont hear someone calling you from the other room.\n5. the controls are actually really good and useful. I thought they'd be a gimmick with the touch pad gesture controls, but they are well thought out and executed well. the menu voice telling you system status, battery life, etc, is also very nice to have and works well. The bluetooth connection works seamlessly too.\n6. And one of the key points that made me choose this one, that I haven't seen in a lot of other noise canceling headphones, is that these will still work as regular headphones even if you don't have to have them powered on (no noise canceling or controls of course) as long as you have them wired up to your device.\n7. the choice of colors-black or white is nice, and the case that they come in is also quality.\n\nI'm not a big Sony fan and thought I'd end up with a Bose or Sennheiser set, but I'm very happy I chose these headphones, these are the best - quality, performance, and value.",

      "body": "These were my first choice but originally purchased the Bose QC35II instead because these were quite a bit higher in price but seemed only marginally better. After being hugely disappointed, I returned the Bose and by luck, these went on sale the same day for $100 off during a 1-day daily deal, and I snapped them up.\n\nMainly purchased these to block out the sound of my downstairs neighbor's bass. It's so loud I can feel the vibration through the floor. These headphones cancel the sound almost entirely!\n\nThe app allows for tons of sound customization but my favorite feature is the sound direction. I mostly wear these while working so I usually have it set to sound as if coming from a source behind me. It's nice to be able to listen to \"background\" music instead of in surround sound when I'm trying to concentrate on work.\n\nI use these paired with a firestick across the room and the Bluetooth works great from about 10 ft away. Sound cuts in and out a bit if I walk into a different room. Pairing them for the first time wasn't super intuitive. Somewhat annoying that they only connect automatically if I turn on the headphones before the firestick, not vice-versa.\n\nI'm not a fan of the touch-sensitive cup since it's easily triggered accidentally. I love that the charging port is USB-C, but the cable it comes with is short and useless.\n\nI was a bit disappointed by the color. It's more of a muddy taupe than silver. But I still prefer it over the black, which shows finger swipes on the touch sensitive cups in every review photo I've seen.\n\nAll in all, this is my favorite pandemic purchase/work-from-home gadget so far. Not sure they're worth the full price, especially with a newer model due to be released soon. But I'm extremely pleased with them for the price I bought them at.",

      "title": "Audio Enthusiasts Perspective",
      "body": "Summary so if you don't want to read all of this: Build is fine, noise cancelling is top notch, headphone requires an EQ to sound decent.\n\nI'm somewhat of an audio enthusiast, although I wouldn't call myself an audiophile. I own several premium headphones (Focal, Audeze, Sennheiser, etc.) as well as various DAC's and headphone amplifiers to suit certain applications. I wanted a pair of headphones to take with me on trips, or to just cancel out ambient noise.\n\nBUILD: Headphones are primarily plastic in construction, although they don't feel cheap by any means. The plastic used here is somewhat rubberized \"soft touch\" which makes them nice to handle. The earcups articulate freely on various axis to accommodate varying head shapes and sizes. No creaking or cracking to be found, solidly built.\n\nNOISE CANCELLATION: These are very impressive at noise cancellation. They practically eliminate almost all ambient noise allowing you to enjoy your music or other media in peace. The Sony app offers fine tuning of how strong the noise cancellation affect is as well, useful for commuting I presume.\n\nSOUND QUALITY: This is where the headphones are lacking the most in my opinion. The sound is FAR too bloated with bass. The bass and mid-bass bleeds into the midrange which makes the entire presentation seem muddy. For me, it is a REQUIREMENT that the bass be EQ'd down about 7 or 8 db for the headphones to sound acceptable. Thankfully, after reducing the bass via EQ, the rest of the frequency range is satisfactory. Its not stellar at soundstaging and imaging, but I didn't expect much seeing as how its a closed back headphone.\n\nAll in all I am satisfied with them. I give them four stars solely due to not being able to listen to them for more than 30 seconds without reducing the bass manually.",

I honestly figured it was just marketing hype, but it's not! I've never experienced anything like it. No joke, you have NOT experienced true silence until you've worn these! You hear absolutely nothing! It was so calming & peacefully quiet, that I actually fell asleep after about 10 minutes of first having them on & I had just unboxed them!\n\nThe audio is smooth, clear & completely distortion free. I'm using it with a OnePlus 7 Pro via Bluetooth 5.0 & LDAC which is at 32 bit 96Khz & quality of 990kbps / 909kbps. Of course it sounds even better through a wired connection.\n\nI've seen people say that these headphones are useless with an external DAC. I am by no means an expert, but I can tell you from first hand experience, that although these sound absolutely incredible by themselves, a DAC makes a very noticeable difference as well. Some believe that ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) ruins the DAC experience. To me it adds too it noticeably! Just like with regular music, the ANC eliminates all ambient noise, so the only thing you are hearing is the music being played. Same thing happens with a DAC, it makes everything that much more detailed. Honestly, I was amazed at what the xDuoo DSD XD-05 DAC did with the Beats Studio 2 I was using, but after hooking up these new Sony's OMG! I wasn't expecting it too be that overwhelming!\n\nBottom line, these things are awesome! I was seriously on the fence about buying them, but now that I've actually used them, I am extremely pleased I got them!\n\nThey're light weight, very well made, extremely comfortable too wear for long durations. They're loaded with features & even support Quick Charge! (15 mins of charging gets you 5 hours of playback! A full charge will get 30 hours!)\n\nYes, they're kinda expensive (which is why I got them on the 0% interest, 5 payment installment option. Thank you Amazon!!!), But honestly they are worth every penny! These are a definite no regret purchase!!!",

      "title": "The Best Pair of Headphones I’ve ever owned -- worth EVERY Penny!",
      "body": "I have been in a search for the perfect pair of headphones seemingly forever. I’m not an audiophile or a purist, but simply have a 1.5 hour commute everyday and like to hear good music on my commute. Over the years I have purchased numerous headphones from different brands and time after time, each one lacked something. Recently, I purchased the Sony WH-CH700N, which were on sale for half off. They sounded great, but the noise cancelling isn’t as great and I’d always have loud talkers on the train creeping in to my music listening. So I began to search for yet another pair of headphones that had better noise cancelling. Time and time again, reviewers were saying that the WH-1000XM3 had the best noise cancelling of any headphones, even better than Bose; however, I could not swallow that $349 price. Fast forward to Black Friday and the WH-1000XM3 were on sale, so I took the plunge – WOW!!! These are the best headphones that I have ever had!! They sound great, with great balance between the highs, midranges and bass. And to my surprise, the reviewers weren’t lying, the noise cancelling on these headphones is out of this world! I’ve only had them for a couple of days, but its like I’m on the train by myself. It pretty much drowns out the world and you’re in your own, just you and your music. And once you set up Sony’s Headphones Connect App to personalize the equalization of your music, you’re in music heaven! My only issue with these great headphones is that they seem to be able to be charged by the cord that came with it, and its quite small and easy to lose. I've tried a couple of different USB-C cables and none of them seem to work (so just to be safe, i'm going to order another one as a back-up.) Now I know the price of these headphones is steep, but trust me, if you’re really into your music, and want to tune out the world while you’re listening, then Sony WH-1000XM3s are definitely worth every penny!",

But this is from an amateur/non-expert guy who just loves his music and will keep it simple.\n\nSound quality: Sony has a noticeably richer sound, better base. Better sound goes to Sony for me.\n\nComfort: Bose are more comfortable and can be worn for a longer period of time with comfort than Sony. Top of my head gets uncomfortable with Sony for long periods over 1-2 hours.\n\nNoise cancellation: Surprisingly Sony is better. I had already owned Bose and when I put Sony on to try at Best Buy...I was well impressed! And decided to buy Sony too simply based on how good the noise cancellation was!\n\nEase of use/practicality: this is about volume buttons etc. Bose is more practical and easier to use -especially the volume buttons. Also Bose can connect to two machines at a time whereas Sony can only do one at a time.\n\nQuality of material: I bought Sony when Bose was 10 months old but within 10 months the ear cushions of Bose had worn out so not the build quality one would expect from $350 headphones(I called Bose and it was under warranty so I got replacements for ear cushions). Verdict is still out for Sony as it’s only been a few months but to be honest the build quality of Sony just feels better than that of Bose.\n\nBattery life: Sony is the winner here by 10 extra hours! Tested both with continuous music.\n\nI’m sorry that I didn’t delve too much into the “quality of sound” subject more but I’m just a regular guy who enjoys his music with good headphones. They are both good headphones but for me Sony is ahead overall. I chose to buy Bose first based on my reading of what experts had said especially about “noise cancellation” but after trying both as a non-expert, my choice is Sony.

      "body": "Let me first start off by saying that this this is my 1st pair of high end noise cancelling headphones.\nIf you're riding the line of \"is it worth it to buy these.. they're $350\" then the answer is probably yes, and i'll explain why.\n\n1.) Sound quality: the sound quality is beyond phenomenal. Even at low volume, you can hear all sound ranges really well with these. With the use of the free Sony headphones app, you can not only alter the bass as desired, but also tailor the specific frequency ranges either manually or through presets such as \"bright, excited, jazz..\" etc. These seriously thump when you turn up the bass- another reviewer was right when they said it feels like it rattles your skull haha.\n\n2.) Build quality: the plastic parts and hinges seem sturdy, and the earcups are very soft leather that do not cause pressure points. Though these are allegedly the heaviest out of its competitors (QC35), you'll likely find that they're so comfy that you may forget that you're wearing them. These new XM3's feature a USB C changing system that are very quick charging. The battery isn't a slouch either- the battery lasts around 30 hours between charges, depending on whether you're using NC or not.\n\n3.) Features: as advertised, the pause, skip forward/backward, palm gesture, and more are all very responsive and useful. The noise cancelling in phenomenal; it even has the ability to \"calibrate\" to your particular face, ears, hair, and glasses. The app lets you control how much noise cancelling you want. For example, on ambient (or adaptive) sound 20, I can practically hear everything as if I were not wearing the headphones at all. At ambient sound 0, it blocks around 98% of the sound and you'd really need to focus to try to hear any sounds that make it through. When you have music playing at any volume, I'd venture to say that the noice cancelling blocks virtually 100% of outside noises- be it HVAC, airplane engines, annoying conversations, blaring TV's, and so on.\n\nHope this helps! If not, there are plentiful reviews on youtube concerning these and its precursors (xm2) in comparison to the Bose QC35",

Headphones have a good quality case that can take some real abuse. It arrived with very simple cartoon picture instructions. So far everything is going fine. Charged them up and wow.\nVery good noise canceling and excellent sound quality. I am a musician, a very critical listener, and I have a good ear. I also used my test CD’s for a frequency check. I am quite happy with the quality of sound, but read on.\nWARNING!\nI purchased these to use in a loud construction environment, operating diesel powered equipment and driving trucks. As much as I’m enjoying them, and as well as they work, they are rather cheaply made and somewhat flimsy. If you purchase be careful. I recommend this product only if it will be used in a normal environment such as inside a car or house. It’s simply not tough enough to wear operating heavy equipment, outside on a lawn mower, anywhere you might need to take them on and off frequently, or if you’re wearing work gloves. I’m disappointed because that was exactly where I needed them. I’m still using solid, construction quality ear protection rather than the Sony headphones. A disappointment for me, but perhaps not everyone is driving diesel trucks and tractors outside in the weather.\nAdditionally Sony could have designed a better hold down strap that keeps the charging and cable cords secure. It’s useless since they will both just fall out. I already lost the charger cord after one use.\nI can’t give you a report on talking on cell phones, so read other reviews.\nTo the big question. Would I buy them again? Do I recommend them? Yes, but only with the understanding they are very easy to break if roughly handled, and the minor complaint the hold down strap in the case is mostly useless.\nSynopsis:\n* Easy to use.\n* Excellent noise cancellation.\n* Excellent sound quality.\n* Good solid case that will take abuse and protect the headphones.",

      "body": "These are the absolute best headphones I have ever owned and they were most certainly worth the money. The noise cancelling is truly incredible. I am currently using this with my gaming computer and it is absolutely fantastic. Paired with my fantastic sound card, my volume hovers at around 20% and it's loud enough with the noise cancelling to block even my own voice.\n\nThe reason I didn't give this 5 stars is even though its build quality is exceptional, the sound quality is exceptional, and the battery is rated for a whopping 30 hours which is very good, I simply cannot excuse Sony's use of a puny little usb c cable. The cable is probably 6 inches long, including the usb c connector and regular usb connector! You are also not given an ac adapter! In order to get this thing charging, I had to get under my desk and hook it up to one of the usb ports in the back of my computer. After three hours, I had to go under my desk again to extract the headphones.\n\nA few months ago I had bought another pair of Sony Bluetooth headphones for working out and they came with a 2 foot cable. I thought that was bad but it seems Sony wanted to amp up their cable shortening game. (if you're wondering why I can't use that cable because it's micro usb and these headphones use usb c) Honestly, you can't beat Sony's engineering but their bean counters or whoever authorized the use of these ridiculously short cables ruined the experience to some extent. Be prepared to get uncomfortable to charge these or fork up the extra money for a useable usb c cable. If you have an extra ac adapter lying around, you will need to use the box these headphones came in as a layer between the headphones and the ground because again, the puny 6 inch cable isn't long enough for you to rest them on a table. I couldn't even place these these on top of my tower computer because the cable wasn't long enough to reach the usb connectors. I truly do find it unacceptable I paid so much money and Sony supplied me with their shortest cable yet!",

      "title": "Great Headphones for Everyday Use",
      "body": "I have been using these for 2 months now and they are great! I had been using AirPods for the last 2 years for wireless listening and after going through 2 pairs due to the battery going out after a year each, and getting tired of recharging them every few hours, I wanted to try something new.\n\nI purchased these due to the price, the battery life and the touch controls. I honestly don't really need the noise cancelling feature, but it is really nice.\n\nThe best thing of all is the 30 hours of use between charges and the very fast recharge to get back to 100%. They are also pretty comfortable, and I assume will get more so the longer I use them. As with all over ear headphones, my ears do get hot after a while, but if you have ever used over ear headphones, you will know this is just something that is going to happen.\n\nThe Bluetooth is great and was very easy to pair. The app that you can download for the iPhone works great to make adjustments to the setting if you need. The automatic setting for the ANC was a little weird at first as I walked around the house and it changed because I was moving, but now I know what to expect and I don't even notice anymore. I can also go all the way across the house and the Bluetooth still connects. As for receiving calls on the headphones, the mic is not the best, but as far as I have read, that is pretty much the case with all of the similar headphones.\n\nThe only thing that took some getting used to is the way that the headphone twist the ear covers to lay flat. I've had wired over ear Bose headphones for about 10 years and they twist the opposite direction. Just something to be aware of if you are used to something else.",

      "title": "Better sound than Bose, but loses on the design front",
      "body": "I bought these to see if they could replace my Bose QC35s. After a week, I'm returning them, since they're just not enough of an upgrade.\n\nPros:\n* The sound quality easily beats Bose. Music sounds more full and there's a much better soundstage.\n* Noise cancellation is a noticeable step up from the QC35s. Optimizing for your hair/glasses makes a noticeable difference.\n\nNow, the cons:\n* My ears don't touch the inside of the headphones on the QC35s, but do on the XM3s. This ended up being a deal-breaker. I can wear the QC35s all day with minimal breaks, and my ears were hurting after even an hour with the XM3s. Even with the better sound quality of the XM3s, I'd buy the QC35 at the same price just because they fit my ears.\n* The controls of the QC35s are just flat-out better than the XM3s'. At their best, the touch controls are finicky, and no match for the buttons on the QC35s. At their worst, if you're wearing them under a jacket in the rain, they'll skip tracks for you and make the headphones unusable. I also have to call out the power button: The switch on the QC35s works perfectly with no fuss every time, and having to switch to holding down a button for three seconds on the XM3s was just an exercise in frustration when I wanted to quickly take them off or put them on.\n* This is likely due to the LDAC codec, but I noticed far more interference and skipping while walking around in the streets of NYC. The QC35s pretty much never skipped, but it was a daily occurrence with the XM3s. I expect switching back to SBC would solve this, but that'd negate a big benefit of the XM3s.\n* This is a smaller issue, but the earpads on the XM3s don't seem to be replaceable. On the QC35s, replacements take less than ten minutes, and cost $10-20. I've seen enough earpads wear out over a few years that I'm worried about the long-term longevity here. (Although given the sealed non-replaceable battery, longevity was probably never a focus here to begin with.)\n\nAnd after going back to the QC35s... I don't feel like I'm missing _very much_ from the sound. If you're a serious audiophile and willing to put up with the compromises, this is easily the best sound you'll get from ANC headphones, and also the best ANC out there, but there are definitely tradeoffs.",

      "title": "Excellent noise canceling and sound quality, along with a very good mobile application.",
      "body": "The noise canceling on these is noticeably improved over the previous generation. The sound quality is excellent, and if you use the Headphones app you can change the base and other EQ settings. The base is good and strong, especially when you turn it up. When you enable noise canceling and run the optimizer, it is phenomenal! Voices are not completely canceled, but in most cases they will be muffled and hard to understand. Play music on top of noise canceling, and you won’t really hear anything at all. I attempted to use these in the dining room which was very loud, and I would say about 90% of the sound was canceled out without playing any music. I’m not sure how these will handle in the car, but I suspect they should be fine. Wind noise might be the only issue, which isn’t that big of a deal. They are extremely comfortable as well. Maybe not quite as good as the QC 35 headphones, but very close. They are a clear step up from last year‘s noise canceling headphones!\nUpdate.\nThe headband is covered in leather and has more Patty. I have not heard of any cracking issues, and the headband feels slightly stronger to me. Also, the swivel pointst feel stronger as well.",

      "title": "Sony vs. Bose",
      "body": "If you're like me, you'd probably want to try out both firsthand before deciding which one you like better. Sony WH1000XM3 and Bose 700 are two of the top rated headphones for 2020 and pricewise are very similar, plus they are both offering promotions currently. So naturally, it will be of benefit for you to experience them both first so that you can compare the features that each has before you come to a final decision on which one was ultimately a better fit for you.\n\nI saw this on a deal for about a hundred bucks off, but Bose is also on a sale for $50 off, for roughly about a hundred more than this headphones. So naturally I decided to try both this and the Bose 700 headphones. Eventually I came to the conclusion liked the features that Bose had more, even though it was a little costlier.\n\nSimilarities between them:\n* Noise cancellation. Both headphones have superb NC, and I feel the difference between them is negligible in this respect.\n* Audio quality is good all around, and Sony offers EQ customization while Bose does not. But still, the sound from Bose sounded richer to me when I was testing it out with a variety of different videos and listening to music.\n* Comfort is mostly the same between them. I'd say the Sony headphones are slightly more accommodating of larger heads and especially any eyeglass wearers in particular.\n\nPro's for Bose:\n* Single touch press to POWER ON/OFF, as opposed to press-and-hold with the Sony ones\n* Nice intro music that plays briefly when powered on, I also liked the voice better. The voice on the Sony is very robotic and not appealing to me at all.\n* It can connect to 2 devices via Bluetooth simultaneously. Did I mention how awesome that is?\n* The design of the headphones looks sleeker and more elegant, certainly I would peg it as more high-end.\n* The sound is overall richer and doesn't require you to fiddle around with EQ settings, so I can let out a sigh of relief and just enjoy the sound.\n* Call quality is excellent and crystal clear. I haven't tested it out on Sony as well, but I would assume it's mostly the same there as well.\n* Voice control is built into the headphones! This is so cool. I have options to choose from like Alexa/Siri/Google. I just need to speak something aloud like \"Alexa, turn on the lights\" and the headphones will respond to me.\n\nBasically an admittedly shallow and somewhat incomplete comparison of the two leading headphone models, but ultimately I decided the Bose 700 headphones were well-deserving of the title for the best headphones. I still think this is an excellent pair of headphones in its own right, and despite the fact that I decided to return it, I think this is a solid purchase for anyone especially if it's on a sale.",
