That's when I found the Highwings 8K/10K HDMI Cable. With a promise of ultra-high speed and a sturdy braid, it seemed like the perfect fit for our needs.\n\nTthe Highwings HDMI cable felt different from others. It's thick, with a noticeable heft and a braided exterior that screams durability. The connectors are solidly built, giving off an impression that this cable is made to last. The length, 6.6 feet, offered just enough flexibility to connect devices without leaving too much slack for our feline friends to find.\n\nOur main concern was whether it could stand up to the occasional cat attack behind the TV. While we don't let our cats chew on cables, accidents happen, and it's reassuring to know that this cable is robust enough to give us a chance to intervene before any real damage is done. The braided exterior isn't just for show; it provides an extra layer of protection that seems to deter even the most persistent of pets.",

			"body": "Review for Highwings 8K HDMI Cable Long 2.1 30FT/9M:\n\nI purchased this cable to replace an Amazon Basics 25ft that was rated for much lower bandwidth. The other cable worked, but was 'fussy' about signal and a bit thicker. I also needed that extra 5 ft. due to a room change.\n\nThis Highwings cable has been used between a Galax 4070ti and a Samsung S90C successfully at 4k 144Hz with no issue. Both the PC and the TV detect everything as it should and I've not had any questionable disconnects, etc. While this does work, if you're using this off of a GPU, you may wish to get an active cable. The 4070ti doesn't seem to like driving this with more than one other display. I normally run 3 monitors plus the TV, but long passive runs like this cause most GPU's to balk at too many displays.\n\nThe cable jacket is nice and has a good feel to it. It's also a but thinner than the older, lower specced cable I had before. It is pretty stiff, though. I can't really fault it as that's a lot of signal to push over passive copper.\n\nIt's a good buy and lives up to it's specs, maybe beyond, but I've not tested that yet.",
