      "title": "LOVE this vacuum - Exceeded my expectations!",
      "body": "While relatives have had them for years, this is MY first robot vacuum. In my opinion, this is the BEST budget vacuum at the price point. I purchased one on sale for $139. It was super easy to get started and watch it go with AMAZING results in the dustbin! Okay, so it was purchased to use at my parents' house, but I HAD to test it, right? :) Now, it worked so well, I immediately ordered 2 more (taking advantage of the $ale) and have 2 at my parents' house and one at my own. I use the schedule feature in the app to run mine every day at 9am. It starts up perfectly. With a Basset hound, it does an amazing job of keeping the house livable in between my own vacuum/mop jobs. I'm a firm believer in doing a deep clean with a larger vacuum, but with this running in between, my house is HUGELY improved. To top it off, running it at my parents' house couldn't be easier with the app. I can start and stop them on MY app, and all they have to do is empty the dust bins. I've been running them for a little over a month now, and am very happy with the results.\n\nPROS: -Runs much longer than predicted, even on standard power. -Easy to empty dustbin. -It has an Air filter (and despite others saying you have to remove screws to get to it, you don't. The outer mesh is fixed in place with a screw, but the filter cartridge slips out the side). -You can \"Set it and forget it\" for the most part if you use scheduling. -Compared to a standard vacuum, this baby is VERY quiet. That isn't to say it doesn't make any noise (seriously, it has suction and airflow... it's GONNA make noise). -If you put it in ECO mode, it is even quieter, but regardless of the mode, my basset doesn't run from it. :)\n\nCONS: All 3 of the models have a 'different' sound when running. Seriously, they each sound completely different and have different noise levels, which makes me wonder. Next, she -her name is Suzie- completely ignores the boundary strips I purchased to use. (And no, I did NOT place it under anything. I even tested by laying it face up straight across the edge of the carpet... on top. NOPE, she rolls right over it -_- ... and the 2nd one I cut to fit the base of a pole lamp that she kept getting stuck half on/off of. Since it was metal, the strip just magnetically attached to the round base side... NOPE, she still bangs into it. Although she hasn't hopped up onto it anymore so... you be the judge)\n\nTIPS: 1st-If you get it on sale, go ahead and add the warranty coverage. I did. In my opinion, a CYA is always a good thing. It gives me piece of mind that if one of them turns out to be a lemon (all things have them, even vehicles) I'm covered. The most I'd have to pay is shipping and that is NOTHING compared to purchasing a new one. Besides, as I said above, they each have a unique motor sound, and I feel better knowing that if there is anything that would take away from the motor life involved, I'll get a repair or a replacement. 2nd-take the time to look at the undercarriage and inspect the roller. You never know what could potentially get wound onto that brush roll, and it's super easy to pop it out and clean it off (if you've ever had a large vacuum, you should already know to do this as regular maintenance). Keep in mind that the harder that brush roll has to work, the more pull it puts on the Motor. Stressing that little thing will potentially take away from its life of service.\n\nFinal Thoughts? I love it and would recommend it to anybody and everybody. And if it's on sale it is HUGE bang for your buck$!\n\n** I gave all 5 stars except the 4 on Deep Cleaning ONLY because of my own beliefs that you need to get out the big vacuum at least once a month (depending on your environment maybe a little more often).",

      "title": "So happy I bought this",
      "body": "I had been wanting a robot vacuum for a long time, with 5 kids and a dog there’s always hair and dirt and crumbs everywhere. It’s so convenient to have the floors cleaned while I’m folding laundry or feeding the baby or washing dishes and it saves me so much time. It’s not perfect, it will not get around the walls perfectly but it does an excellent job going from wood to rug to carpet. I was shocked and disgusted by the amount of dirt it picked up the first time. It’s definitely worth the money to me. It’s not too loud, the baby naps while it’s running sometimes. It is stupid though and will bump into things, it gets under my dining room table with all the chairs and doesn’t get trapped though. I’d definitely recommend getting one.",

      "title": "Great Basic Entry Level Robot Vac - But could use a better WiFi phone APP",
      "body": "My Spouse has wanted a robot vac for a while. Saw a great pre-Prime Day sale for this one, read the reviews and ordered one. We've had it about 2 weeks and have run it all but perhaps 2 days of that. We get a lot of dust in Central Colorado thanks to our near non-existent humidity and we're impressed enough with this that it's now programmed to run daily. It can keep up with that bit of maintenance for us for most of the time and we can do more of the other things we'd rather be doing. Only time will tell how it holds up, but so far we're pretty happy with it.\n\nVery good suction on our all-hardwood main level floor (about 1300 ft) that includes many area rugs, many obstacles, a large black dog shedding randomly everywhere he can, and a central raised front entry area that cuts the vac off from much of the direct path between spaces on that level. Takes 90-120 minutes to cover the entire 1st floor spaces using about 80% of its battery capacity. Because of the main floor room layout & path obstructions, it spends a good portion of that time at the end trying to find its dock if it decides it's finished while on the wrong side of our raised entry foyer. I'd expect it would handle a similar sized space that had fewer obstructions a bit faster (Maybe I'll build it a set of removable ramps to get past the entry area). Still considering it's doing the work instead of you, how much should you care if it spends 30 extra minutes doing that job. BTW, this low end model does NOT restart a cleaning cycle if it runs out of battery even though it does \"know\" enough to sense low battery and then try to find its charging dock. Bottom line - it has enough Battery to get its job done and done well and it recharges quickly enough that you can send it off elsewhere later in the day (or night)\n\nThis is a random pattern vac-bot - that is, it runs along until it bumps into something and then redirects depending on which sensor gets tapped. It moves rather slowly and while I occasionally cringe as it runs into some of our 3rd & 4th generation family heirloom furniture, it does not appear to hurt anything with it's slow speed and soft rubber bumpers. Others have complained otherwise - we're not seeing that.\n\nIt has no real trouble with the heavy oriental area rugs we have around the place and even the fringes (about 2\" long) along their edges on some don't seem to be an issue. We have found a couple of places where we need to cut back some heavier (1/2\" thick) anti-slip rug pads so there is a bit of a ramp at the edge of the rug, but generally this little bot (we named her Rosie) has very little trouble getting up onto some of rather thick rugs. Thin bath mats or the bath towel our dog uses as a food redistribution and sorting location in the dining room are problematic. 90% of the time they'll curl up and Rosie tries to go mountain climbing. She gets around or over those more often than not, but it's easier to just pick them up temporarily. Power cords are also a problem, so we try to keep those up against baseboards or protected where possible. I suspect these are issues with most all of these robot vacs and also with the u-push it yourself types. It's lower profile than some of its competitors, so on occasion it will find a path under something and can't find its way out. This model did not come with any of the magnetic strips you can use to block it from certain areas, but we're going to try some of those to keep it out of those areas. The bot has built in \"cliff sensors\" so it also won't run off the edge of a stairway. It just senses the edge, stops and turns away. Haven't had it take a tumble yet. The sensors do on occasion get fooled by the wood grain and abrupt grain based color transitions in our floors, but so what. It's a random pattern robot, so it gets to those spots eventually, just from another direction.\n\nThe dust bin on this one is fairly large compared to others from what I've read. The first couple of times we ran it, the bin was well packed after both runs. By the third run onward, we started to notice a definite decrease and of much lower density. We generally walk around barefoot and my wife could politely be described as a clean freak so we were amazed at how much this little bot was finding compared to us with our larger and higher powered u-push type vacs and how much cleaner the floor felt.\n\nAfter each run, we empty the dust bin, clean any dog (or human) hair out of the rollers and brush out the air filters. Takes maybe five minutes. It's a bit awkward the first few times until you get the knack of opening the bin and how things snap or slide in and out. You do need to replace the brushes and filters at some interval that is going to be dependent on your surfaces and \"dirt profile\", but it's likely to be measured in months if you just do the basic post cycle routine they recommend in the rather thin guide booklet.\n\nBasically, this is a good little lightweight machine for a relatively lightweight price. If you want a robot vac, but the prices of the units with more bells and whistles are scaring you off, this is a good choice to test the waters. If you find you like it but wish it had a few more capabilities for some areas, buy a fancier one for another level or that area in your home. If you find you don't, you're not out a small fortune having paid for features that while nice, are not going to change your life either no matter how cool. I think some of the relatively few bad reviews are from people that expect too much or don't take the time to let their robot \"teach\" them how to successfully use it. These are not Star Trek level intelligent devices. Bend a little to meet their needs however, and they are really helpful gadgets to have around.\n\nNow the bad news and why I took off a star. The APP / Alexa Skill. Clearly the developer thinks they have better things to spend their time on. This is one the poorer set up apps I've seen in a while. Awkward to use, out of date, would not recognize the model number as valid even though it scanned it from the QR label without issue, awkward connection to WiFi network and disconnects / fails to reconnect (worst of my 24 other very reliable devices on my network in that regard). Low functionality, but if you want to integrate with Amazon Echo/Alexa or Google Home for voice control you need it. It's also handy (when it works, which is still most of the time) to let you know if the robot got stuck somewhere or has run into an issue. You can live without it, but it would be soooo much nicer if this app was a bit more user friendly and reliable. It's my only significant complaint and this part needs some work by the company.",

      "body": "We have a 3 bed, 2.5 bath 2 story town house. Our home has 4 people and 1 cat. We have had this 12 days and have used it about every other day.\n\nThis works great! Our downstairs is hardwood and our upstairs is carpet. It does great on both floors. Couple of issues it does have. I have a standing ott light in the living room for sewing, it does try to climb up the stand and get stuck, same with our stand-up fan. Our downstairs is a hallway, living room, kitchen dining and half bath. it does a great job sweeping there, I do pick up the cat toys before turning it on.\n\nWhen we want it to vac the upstairs, we move the base upstairs and only have the doors open for the rooms we want it to clean. (Upstairs we have 3 beds, a bath and laundry room) But it picked up plenty of cat hair in our carpet that we didn't know was there, and we have a short-hair cat. Our upstairs bath has a rug with long fibers, so I don't let it go in that room either. But it does great in the larger master bath that has no rug.\n\nI have the Shark app and Alexa. I usually don't use the app or Alexa to turn it on as I want to make sure my daughter has picked up her legos and that the main bathroom door is closed. For downstairs I pick up the cat toys and the breakfast bar stools. However, it does get under our entertainment center just fine and it navigates any cords on the floor without a problem. Additionally, I have a sewing space in our dining room and it gets little threads easily. It has a large container to collect the dust, but not as large as a traditional vac. However, it is easier to vacuum more often with this as it does it on its own, so as you use it more often, hopefully it has less to pick up. The vacuuming process is longer with this than a traditional vac, but that is okay, I don't have to be with it all the time like I do with a traditional vac. When I want it to clean a different floor I just take it and its base upstairs, plug in the base and press the button. I make sure that notifications are turned on in the Shark app and it will notify me if it has gotten stuck. Although I have it linked to Alexa and I use Alexa often and have several Alexas in several rooms, Alexa never gives me notifications on this. But this isn't something that bothers me, just an fyi if that is important to you.\n\nCouple of things. I have 5 children and 4 are grown (my 23 year old and 8 year old live with me) I don't know if I would have used this as much when I had small children and lots of toys around. Although it would have vac'd around them, I don't think it would have done as thorough of a job. I also like to be home when it is running, so I can keep an eye on it in case it gets stuck. It doesn't get stuck often, but I wouldn't want to come home and find it was stuck and hadn't done what I expected of it, but that is my personal preference.\n\nOverall, I love this thing. I think it does a great job and is easy to use. I would recommend this.",

      "title": "Very unintelligent....",
      "body": "I do NOT recommend this model.\n\nI used to have the RV750/R75 until the motor or something in it that spun the brush roll failed after 2 years and Shark CS advised me that particular unit was obsolete and replacement parts were no longer made. So I bought this, the AV751.\n\nIt's dumb as a stump in comparison. It rams into everything (causing it to push around smaller/lighter things), never goes into edge cleaning mode like the other one did, pushes the magnetic strips around, and will even run into its own dock (moving it so that sometimes it can't dock when done)!\n\nIt will also randomly stop then play its \"starting\" music/tones and start going again, resulting in the run time as shown in the app to reset. It has also on occasion suddenly started from the dock without anyone telling it to! (Though this is usually some minutes after it returned to the dock on its own, but not due to low battery.)\n\nIt also seems to have this issue with the magnetic strips when it goes into dock mode. If it is attempting to return to dock, but is in some area where it can't detect its dock, and then it runs across a magnetic strip, it will become obsessed with attempting to find a way around the strip. It'll either eventually succeed (I've come home before and found it in an area it shouldn't have been and couldn't figure out why), or it'll eventually give up and stop, sending a notification to the app saying it is stuck on a magnetic boundary strip.\n\nThe dust bin is also designed differently and, in my opinion, poorly. The lid is held shut with a couple small balls that fit into holes on the bin. As a result, when opening, it sort of \"pops\" open, causing a small cloud of dust to poof out. I have bad allergies to dust. That small poof is enough to put me out of commission for the rest of the day if I breathe it in. The old model unit I had, the lid merely rested on top of the bin, so this was not an issue. In this new unit, the filter can also sometimes slip out while opening/emptying because of the way it's designed and positioned (again, not an issue with the older model).\n\nOtherwise, the battery life seems great compared to the old model I had. Lasts about twice as long. However, for whatever reason, the unit won't actually run the whole duration unless it can't detect it's dock (ie, putting it into another room). It'll only run about an hour (half duration) before auto returning to the dock.\n\nThis unit is dumb enough that it's making me regret my decision to buy it....\n\nUpdate (4/22/21): So, to make matters worse, this morning I woke up to the unit making a beep every few seconds. Couldn't figure it out, so called Shark. They inform me that a bad update went out for this particular model (AV751) and that it should be resolved in another couple of hours. I obviously have questions on how this happened, but whatever. I can wait a couple hours.\n\n4 and a half hours later... it's still doing it. I call them back. They now inform me that my unit is going to have to be replaced and it's going to take upwards of 10 days to arrive. Grrr.... Oh, and it's the base unit, only. It's on me to swap the brushes, roller, battery, etc to the new unit. *rolls eyes* But then, they need to check the warranty status to make sure I qualify. Excuse me?? You all sent out a bad update that bricked my unit, but if it's not in warranty I'm SOL??? It was in warranty still (only 6 months old), but what I'm hearing is that if in another 6 months to a year this happens again, it's gonna be on me to replace. I'm so pissed right now. >:(\n\nUpdate (8/27/22): One of the wheels that drives it has stopped working. It just goes round and round in circles, now. This is the second Shark ION Robot that I've had that breaks in 2 years. I just bought an iRobot 600 series to replace it....",

      "title": "Works great as an emotional support robot, havent been able to get it to connect to wifi.",
      "body": "This little guy has been the only consistent thing in my life for the past year, and watching him bounce around the house has really been a solid anchoring point in my life. A lot of stress, my own-self moving between several houses, dealing with animals that aren't mine making houses disgusting, life being so generally uncertain at any given time here in the ole US of A, and during all of that, I know if I walk over, hit the \"MAX\" button on my little shark, at least all the dog fur, the dust, and most of the dirt on the floor is gonna be gone in a few hours without lifting a finger. This has been so massive to improve my quality of life. Not to use Amazon Dot Com as my therapist, but when I got this I was dealing with loud, disgusting, dirty, not-cleaning-up-after-pet roommates and I was hoping for SOME saving grace and help in the house. The little shark has been my super hero, and honestly the cleanest roommate I've ever had. I went from floors tainted dark from fur and dander, to pleasant to look at carpets and hardwood floors that i dont even have to pre vacuum before inviting guests over.\n\nThat sounds silly, and is probably exaggerated a bit, but for real, having this cheap little robot just do his daily cleaning, leaving me less stressed with my day to day tasks knowing at least my floor will be clean in hectic households has an importance worth more than money.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n1.) It cleans. It does a pretty d*mn good job at it too. As I said above, life (for everyone) has been hectic the past few years. It seriously turned my gross floors (i absolutely didnt touch the floors for a week knowing it was in the mail, had to put it through the ringer when i got it) into something I could walk barefoot on without having to clean my feet before going to bed. It isn't perfect, it doesnt get as deep as a decent vacuum, but hey the first 80% of a job is the most important right?\n\n2.) battery is great. It'll run in max mode for at least a few hours, and it's never died before cleaning whatever floor i put it on. It's been running in my room the entirety of writing this review (about an hour since i hit go) and only lost 1/3 bars of battery. Battery is easily a 5 star, and you can get new ones on the shark site.\n\n3.) serviceability. As a firm believer in right to repair, this is massive. And why despite the bad down below, I plan on keeping this. You can take 90% of it apart with just your hands and no tools, and all the wear parts are incredibly easy to swap out. As of writing this review (june 2022) I can find all the parts online if i needed directly from shark.\n\nTHE BAD: I would not buy this at full price. I got mine on a massive black friday sale, and on top of that, had a gift card from work. All in all, I only paid around $20 of my own cash for this which is probably why I love it so much. Its not without its fair share of problems though.\n\n1.) The internet will not work. I have tried /everything./ This is a home filled with IT professionals and resetting, using different devices, giving it it's own 5g, or 2.4, or hybrid network will not get it to connect. Tried 3 android devides running different versions, tried 2 IOS devices using different versions, and it just absolutely will not connect. Tried again after a few months hoping there would be some updates, no dice. Tried different router, nothing. Tried an entirely different house, different router, different service provider, and device (in case it wanted a change of scenery I guess?) and nothing. Definitely something faulty from factory. This is why it's 3 star. I'm sure if I could get it to connect, it would update and get modern firmware that fixes other issues, which will be listed below.\n\n2.) the pattern (without internet at least, which is the only way ive been able to use this as above stated) is ENTIRELY random. My roommate has a much more expensive ECOVACS Robotics - DEEBOT T8+ for a different floor of the house, and let me say, it does this sharks job better in every single way. The shark just bounces in every direction using a shotgun approach to clean the floor. It gets the floor clean, but it could do it much quicker and much quieter if it used any kind of AI or mapping to clean the floor.\n\n3.) doesnt know how to drive straight always. The random mapping works via shotgun approach as stated above, but it will occasionally miss spots as it forgets how to spin the wheels at the same speed and does massive archs over areas instead of straight lines. Its intermittent though so I cant tell if its intentionally programmed to do so. This alone wouldnt make me drop a star, its more of combined with other issues.\n\n4.) gets clogged with dust quick, losing suction. A bit hard to clean the pre filter. I do live in utah, where its dusty and i expect to clean any device with an air intake more than most other places in the country/world. That said, it clogs pretty quick (each use basically) meaning I have to get my portable air gun and spend 5 or so minutes blowing it out each use. Again, nothing horrible. Just worth noting.\n\nSUMMARY: This little guy cleans. He's kinda dumb, bumps into walls, gets stuck in small spaces on occasion, hates the internet (who doesnt at this point?) but he's been an incredibly welcome and reliable addition to my life and i dont regret paying the 20 or so dollars to get him.",

After moving I decided I was tired of sweeping and just wanted to get something that would clean up and was cheap. This fit the bill! It doesn’t map at all and bumps into everything. It just goes wild around the house, bumping into something, turning and running off to bump into something else. In fact, as I write this, I hear it in the other room bumping into something literally over and over while it tries to find the dock. Comical at first. Terrible to run in the middle of the night, like I used to do, because it bangs into the wall, lamp, furniture and wakes me up. BUT! Despite all that bumping, it’s a great little vacuum. Eventually it gets to the majority of the spaces, cleans up well, keeps dust and pet hair down, empties easily and is a great help. Hopefully it lasts a good while! I’m very happy with the cleaning part of it so far!\n\nIt was easy to connect to the wifi and had only gone off it once. Easy to connect with Alexa but I didn’t like using it with that so disconnected. I would recommend for a starter vac!",

They are much smaller than legos, but can hurt my old feet if they hit just right. My lady sweeps every day, heavy cleanup on weekends, and works a regular job. I got this unit hoping to help her out. Ran it first time while me and visiting family were home, to see what was what. It is a conscientious little bee, working everything it can find! Runs straight until it lightly bumps something, then backs up 3/4” rotates x degrees, tries to move forward again. If it bumps something else, it does same action, but degree of return changes. So, it has got caught up for a minute under rocking chair, but gets out. Doesn’t waste an hour trying to do so, or quit! I have 1 story house, mix of hardwood and tile, with some area rugs and feet mats by sink, stove, etc. Unit adjusts to different elevations easily. There is an easily removable little catch basin on unit. You pinch and pull back, take to garbage, pinch another top, and dump. There is a hepa type filter, and your standard (although smaller) vacuum roller brush thing. Super easy to remove and get twisted head hair, paper shred, bread tie, whatever off of it. It is quiet enough, especially in another room, but if in same room, I just turn up the tv a couple clicks. There is an app I put on phone to program to clean when we are gone. It has been found off docking port twice. It has several re tries if it gets off balance, but will shut down instead of running itself dry (battery). I have held off buying this for a couple years, and found out that was silly. It is an awesome machine, it helps with your dailies, and is worth every penny. The cats aren’t too too scared, and we haven’t witnessed them riding it yet. Noise it not an issue, very easy to access for cleaning, I have had no reason to contact company for service or parts, will update in a year",

I tried everything to get the connection to work until I saw a review (and subsequently a Utube clip) informing of the SSID/embedded-space problem. Tried the easy fix and it worked first time. I had already defined a 2.4GHz guest network which works but has never been used until the Shark.\n\nUPDATE: The vac would not stay in Dock mode when commanded via the app. Would drop out of Dock mode and revert to Clean; meanwhile, the app would freeze thinking the vac was on its way back to doc.

It would not stay connected to the router and it never even tried to re-connect, requiring a delete of robot and re-add, only to repet the cycle. Sent it back immediately for refund and ordered an RV2310.\n\nThe app is adequate. Clunky flow, somewhat slow, not entirely intuitive in its GUI but it does allow phone control.\n\nThe Shark itself wanders aimlessly but, eventually, it does get around to rooms e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, TV rooms. Whatever it covers is by pure chance but, in its two hour clean cycle it picks up a lot. We live in Phoenix so dust is omnipresent day-to-day. The unit does pretty well in scouring the floors, which are all hardwood with a couple of throw rugs. Emptying the bin is almost a must after after every clean.\n\nIt seems to find its dock reliably; battery life is a good 2.5 to 3.0 hrs.\n\nScheduling works fine; noise level is not obnoxious; charge time is several hours.\n\nClearly we'll still be manually vacuuming around the edges, etc. every so often but the overall floor surfaces are noticeably dust free now that the Shark is running around (daily actually).\n\nShark needs to update the firmware and spiff up the app (it's currently cute, now let's guide it to maturity).",

      "body": "I've wanted a little robot vacuum for a long time. One I could control via my Echo and was slightly \"smart\". My home gets dusty fairly quickly and I have bad dust mite allergies so cleaning can be a literal pain. I mostly wanted the vacuum for one room, my bedroom. I don't know how efficient my little Baby Shark would be in a larger space, but for a smaller space she is perfect. I've run her about every 3-4 days and the dust cup is always fairly full, and I always notice how much easier it is to breathe dust-free after she's done her routine.\n\nSet up was a breeze. Snapped the brushes into place, set the dock up, downloaded the app. Easily connected to my wifi and set up the Shark skill in my Echo app too. I had to name the vacuum, and I have a larger non-intelligent shark vacuum, hence \"Baby Shark\", but now I can inform Alexa to start cleaning. The Shark app is nice. I can also control the robot from there, see how long it has been running, switch modes, see how much charge is left, or dock it, all without being in the room. It is a fairly simple intuitive interface.\n\nThe battery life is sufficient for a good clean. After about an hour and a half she's down to 50% on the Max mode. She won't pick up large items but I'm always amazed at how much dust she gets. My hair is long and sheds a lot but she's an expert at getting that up from my vinyl floors and my thin rugs too. The dust cup is kind of small but it holds the dust she picks up with a little spare room. As for noise, she's on the quiet side for a vacuum. I've easily concentrated on work at my desk or watched a show while she's running. She does have a few beeping sequences when she's turned on, switching modes, or docking. I find it cute but might annoy others. The indicator lights for wifi and charging are pretty standard as well. I like the option of scheduling her runs, but I generally just set her to go when I have a little time to pick up some potential obstacles in her path.\n\nShe can get in the awkward corners under my half circle corner shelves that I struggled to clean with the regular vacuum. She goes under my bed with ease. Under my desk and my desk chair as well. I do make sure to lift all the cords and trip hazards from her potential path. She so far hasn't gotten stuck or gotten something tangled in her roller. She doesn't map anything intelligently like some more expensive models, but she does seem to get into all the corners and under all the furniture on a single run. It may take her a few go arounds to get into a specific tight spot, but letting her go for at least an hour generally she goes over everything possible.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with Baby Shark. We'll see how long she lasts with casual use.\n\n***2021 Update 6ish months in***\n\nWell my poor baby shark died today. She was beeping continuously and not connecting to wifi. I tried some troubleshooting steps on the app and then called customer service.\n\nIt’s not the first time I had a Shark product die on me. But I’m never upset because the customer service for this company is really amazing. I called and connected right away with someone we did a video-call and identified the problem. Long story short, it had an internal error so I’m being sent a replacement for free.\n\nThe battery life stayed pretty consistent through this time period. A little disappointed the machine died so quickly when I really use it 2x a/4 hours a week at most. But on the other hand the company stands by their product and I’m getting a replacement. Thought I’d update my review about it.",

      "body": "If you’re looking for a smart robot vacuum, this ain’t it…. This vacuum goes about its’ merry way, slamming into everything at full speed; there doesn’t seem to be anything to indicate that it is capable of not ramming everything it gets close to. You can also scratch that nonsense about this vacuum “knowing your house”. It chronically gets stuck in the same predictable spots, day after day and I usually end up having to rescue it when I get home from work. Ditto stairs. Pretty much any time that I leave the bedroom door open, whatever sensors that this little dumbot possesses, tell it to go straight to the door and down the stairs.\n\nAll of our flooring has been replaced with tile and this robot DOES clean that exceptionally well, with enough capacity to run twice a day, several days in a row, without emptying the dirt bin. I also can’t complain about the battery capacity because it’s averaging about an hour and a half of runtime each time it cleans. I don’t know if it would run longer if it was sensing anything to pick up but I haven’t noticed any unusually short runtimes yet.\nPart of me wants to advise folks to run this while they’re away, just to avoid the noise of the continuous slamming into walls and other things, but I can also say that the machine is in constant need of rescue and ends up needing quite a bit of human supervision. Maybe a good compromise is to program it to run when you’re at home but nobody is trying to sleep or concentrate on anything important.\nHaving owned a number of roombas and ilifes over the years, I believe that this shark model cleans as well as either of those brands but is a far dumber machine than the roomba. If not for the incessant high speed collisions with everything in its path, I’d say that this is the quietest robot vac I’ve owned so far but the banging and the need to frequently rescue it renders that point negligible.\n\nI can’t speak for Alexa integration, because that’s far more intrusive than anything i’d. ever have in my home but the app is effective for starting the vacuum while you’re away and monitoring cleaning time, just know that, if you start it while you’re away, you’ll likely need to find it and restart it as soon as you get home.\nAt this point, I’m going to say that this machine cleans well, saves me a lot of effort and was well worth what I paid for it (because it was deeply discounted) but if you’re actually expecting one that is going to ever learn the layout of your home, you’re likely to be seriously disappointed.\n\nUpdate, as of 9/9/2022: Still surprised at how “not smart” this vacuum is…. 0615 is its’ normal morning cleaning time. Using the app, I told it to return to dock, within 10 seconds of it starting. Half an hour later, it’s still searching for the dock that it was less than 6 feet away from when it was told to go home.",

      "body": "I've tried thus vaccum at least 5x now. Initially I thought it didn't really have good suction power, but it could be because of the type of rugs I have, so I didn't really notice the 'lines' etc, and my house wasn't super dirty either, but when I opened up the dust compartment, wow, it looked pretty close to what I see on my normal vaccum where I manually vaccum the house.\nThat sold me, and I figured I didn't have to return.\nStill not sure if the app is working properly. Have to try another time.\n\nWhat this vaccum does not do:\n- it doesn't map your house. So you won't be able to program it to clean certain rooms at certain times, and there might be missing areas when it runs.\n\n- it doesn't have a sensor, so it will bump into walls and furniture, and it is quite loud when it does.\n(For parents like us who use white noise machines, and have the monitor out loud on our bed, we don't really hear the vaccum with our bedroom door closed). So it works for us and we can run it at night. If you are worried it will wake you up a night, just run it when you are out of the house, or take turns in rooms you're not using during the day.\n\n- apparently it needs a lot of space on both sides and front when resting on its dock. So you need quite a big of a free wall to do that.\nI don't have that so, I found the best place I could,then moved a few things around and only leave it on dock when it needs to be charged or when I programed it to clean the house. Then, when it is done, I just turn it off, unplug it and put it away. That actually works better for me as I have a toddler around :).\n\nWhat it does:\n- It does a pretty good job at cleaning and removing annoying dirty/dust.\n\n- Mine it is actually pretty quite, only when it bumps into things that it makes a loud sound.\n\n- Through the app you can schedule cleanings.\n\n- Even though it doest map your house and you might get certain areas not cleaned, I found out that our apartment looks very good and it didn't seem like it missed anything. We do live in a small space though.\n\nIt is only the first week, so I'll get back here if there is a need for an update.\n\nTotally recommend it. I'm on my second pregnancy now and at the end of my third trimester, so vacuuming was making me very tired and feeling a lot of pain afterwards. This is being such a great help so far and I'm sure it will come in very handy when baby girl arrives!\n\nNote: just like with a normal manual vaccum, if you want a nice clean place, you gotta move things around, bring things up etc. If you do that, and prep the place, not only you will get a nicer job done by this robot, but will also prevent it from getting caught into things.",

      "body": "Does the app kind of suck? Yeah. It's a 2 to 3 star app at best but at least I was able to get it set up to schedule cleanings. If you try to use it to pause or dock the unit while the unit, forget it. Can she (i.e., the unit who shall be from this point forward referred to as \"Sharkayla\" or \"Sharkayla the god\") pick up bigger objects like a walnut half, for instance? No...and don't judge me. But what she can do in her own meandering way is find her way through a whole 2800 sq ft house, making her way under every bed, desk and sofa on one charge. I'm not even mad about the stuff she can't pick up because she pushes it out from wherever it was hiding so you can pick it up and dispose of it. I already mentioned the walnut half but there was also a cheeto, a blush brush that I haven't seen in a year, a long twist tie, and a peanut (circa Christmas Party of 2018) that must have been lodged under some piece of furniture.\nAt first, I didn't get the zip zag approach and how she moved to another room before she finished that room...but that's how she rolls...and she revisits to pick up what she missed. I was also impressed by the charge. She cleaned on a single charge for over 2 hours, getting stuck only for a moment or two. I have a shaggy area rug in my guest bedroom that she can't handle, but who cares! It's small enough that I can take it outside and shake it or use my regular vacuum on it. I have two, higher traffic area hallways in my house and she navigated both and found every room in the house. This impressed me because I own a Mint robotic cleaner. It's not a vacuum. It's more of a duster/damp mop. I have hardwood laminate throughout my home and only a few area rugs. The Mint had difficulty navigating hallways and I would always have to block the hallways and carry the unit by hand to any room off of a hallway, making sure to close the door of that room so it couldn't wander out into the hallway and have a meltdown. No such problems with the Shark unit. I will say that the Mint goes in mostly straight lines which is why I was initially perplexed by the zigzagging of the Shark.\nAs for noise levels that some reviewers complained about, I would definitely not let it clean in the wee hours while people are sleeping but still, it's not terrible. The motor is not loud to me. Most of the noise comes from the clacking sound it makes as it bumps against things to establish boundaries.\nI work from home and I require relative quiet for my work She came into my office twice while I was working and all I did is lift my legs up and say \"Girl, do your thing\". It wasn't unbearable.\nI'm overjoyed because I work all day and although I vacuum regularly, I don't regularly move beds, sofas and desks. Most of the time, I would periodically get my broom to try to get what I could or I would set the Mint in a room and close the door but its weak charge would only allow you to do a room or two at a time...plus you had to baby sit it a bit for the reasons I mentioned.

      "body": "This is my first robot vacuum I've ever owned and wasn't sure what to really expect. Hence the reason I'm writing a review.\n\nI would first like to say the WiFi/App setup is borderline impossible, which is expected because troubleshooting is posted everywhere on the box, instructions and everything else, showing that it's a very, very common struggle for probably everyone. So I have no idea how well the app works or what it even does? Once you're beyond the fact that you can't use the app or WiFi, you get to go old school and just let the vacuum choose the life it wants to live. It's fairly simple once you get the docking station setup. Just press the clean button, it plays cute music and it's off to indoor bumper cars. This vacuum uses crashing into things technology as a way to guide itself, for me, this isn't a big deal, but for some you might not want the robot constantly hitting walls, furniture, and any other items around the house.\n\nThe main reason I bought this vacuum was the fact I have a German Sheppard who sheds like no tomorrow, I thought this would be a good way to combat the constant shedding and constant cleaning up. The first couple days of use the vacuum was picking up insane amounts of dog hair. I quickly realized that the way the vacuum functions, even thought it has a fairly large area to store dirt and debris, it's not strong enough to push it all the way to the back, so it more or less only fills up about a 1/4 of the way and then it's done. The issue is the vacuum does not stop when it fills or has no more room, you have to check on this or else it just keeps vacuuming and more or less moving the dirt or debris to around the house.\n\nAfter the 3rd day of use though, the vacuum had cleaned up so well the first 2 days that it was now functioning at a much higher level, not filling up nearly as fast and the floor looked amazing, almost better then when I had to manually go down and vacuum because I couldn't always see the hair.\n\nThe vacuum has no rhyme or reason to where it travels, sometimes it will clean the same area over and over but eventually leaves and goes onto bigger and better things, regardless of the cleaning pattern making any sense, the fact it can run for about 2 hours on one charge, it can get my 2,000 square foot downstairs cleaned up on one charge. My floors are all hardwood with a few throw rugs, I'm not sure how well this bad boy would work on carpet only, but it works great on hardwood surfaces.\n\nOverall, even without WiFi, the app or really any other advertised features working, this vacuum does an amazing job keeping my pets hair off the floor and allowing me time to worry about other things then cleaning up after my furball on a daily basis. I recommend running it daily because once it gets things cleaned up, it does an even better job keeping things up to par after that with less emptying of the dirt and debris storage.\n\nHopefully this rambling review helped someone!",

I pick him up and put him near the dock and push the Dock button to send him back to bed to charge. No big deal.\n\nBefore the first use I vacuumed everything (what I thought was) thoroughly and set the little guy loose. My place is not large (<1000 sf) but several rooms and obstacles (some of which I've learned to just pick up before setting Sharky loose, which works just fine) and I was amused to see him randomly crossing the room, bumping the baseboard and moving off in another direction. Totally random, and I was not convinced it was vacuuming the whole room, but after I sent him to charge I looked at the throw rugs and could see the imprints of his wheels and it looked like he went over pretty much everything.\n\nDay two I ran him again, quite happy.\n\nDay three I ran him and he didn't seem to be picking up much. I was disappointed my hair issue had not been solved. I decided to look more closely and see what the problem could be. You guessed it - I had not cleaned out the dust cup after the first day (I'd already vacuumed as good as I ever do, so how much was there for this thing pick up, right?) and it was darned near too full to get it open! After emptying the dust compartment, brushing off the filter and cleaning the hair off the brush it ran perfectly! The key is to empty it every time you run it - you will be horrified at how much dust, dirt and hair this thing picks up, especially if you cleaned first, as I did.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy the accessory kit that has extra brushes, filter and cleaning brush - you'll be very glad you did because it makes cleaning it out so much easier.\n\nIf you don't care about using an app and you don't mind the random patterns, this Sharky will get the job done for less money than the competitors. It could be quieter, but it's not as loud as a regular vacuum. The only thing I've found it won't go over is cords - make sure you get them all off the floor in advance because it will get stuck every time.\n\nOverall very happy after consistent use over 7 months.",

I should go out the way I came.\" it will bump around and around and around rather than day ok, I got into this thing old just reverse the steps that got me here and get out. Nope, again it'll just bang around and around and around.\n\nIt's even dumber while docking. Ok, if I point it at the dock it will find it's way home. But I'll hit the 'Dock' button and watch it attempt to dock. Or will go towards the dock and turn left. Nope something is in the way. Ok spin around, move a foot then spin again on the original direction. Oh shoot someone is in the way again.... Could it be the same thing that was just on the way? Yes on fact it is. I watched it do this for 10 minutes. Finally I took pity on this little machine and put it right in front of the dock. Luckily, it found it's way home then.\n\nThird, it will not sync with the app. Rebooted the vacuum. No luck. Rebooted vacuum and my phone. No luck. Rebooted the vacuum, my phone and my router. No luck.\n\nFourth, circling back to is lack of intelligence. I will watch it miss something on the floor. And it will go along and odd angles completely missing that spot.\n\nNow if I run it for an hour the odds of it going over that spot is good. But listening to this thing suck for an hour and bang into the same object or wall for an hour isn't pleasant.\n\n\"Oh, just turn it on when you leave the house\" you say... Yeah, half the time I run it something had become stuck in the brush causing it to turn off. I don't blame the vacuum for this. But if I could run it at home comfortably, then it wouldn't be an issue.\n\nUnfortunately, this going back. It's easier to endure vacuuming for fifteen minutes than to listen to this thing suck and bumble it's way around the house.",

      "body": "Here are the things to keep in mind: robot vacuums, at least the lower budget models I've tried, are only so useful. They are good for keeping your floors basically clean. None of the them are going to be perfect at getting everything and not getting stuck. Maybe the higher end models already have that tech, or maybe it's coming later, but the lower end models are going to bop around and crash into stuff and get stuck.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID. I think this model is pretty good. We previously owned a Eufy which broke right outside the warranty period and then when I did some digging I discovered that's extremely common. So, it was nice while it lasted, but I'm not willing to purchase their products anymore. We have an upright Shark that I love so I thought we'd try a shark robovac. I was able to get this one for a steal, so, definitely I would recommend holding out for deals vs. paying full price.\n\nI'll try to update later on with comments about longevity, but thus far, after about 1 month of use:\n\nPROS:\n\n-- Good suction/cleaning power. The dirt tray gets pretty full of cat hair and dirt. Honestly, if you are a pet owner and esepcailly if you have multiple pets, a robo vac is for you. It's just about keeping the floor situation under control. You're going to need more than a robo vac, but this will seriously help with day-to-day cleaning.\n-- Good battery life. I haven't really tracked but it seems like it runs for 2.5-3 hours at a time?\n-- Seems better than our Eufy about getting stuck on objects. The eufy was forever getting stuck on shoes, shirts, cords, etc. Yes, we are messy and this is partially our fault. Ideally you should pick up all clutter. But if you are lazy enough to want a robo vaccuum, chances are you might be lazy enough to have a cluttered floor also. This one does occasionally get stuck but it's not like the eufy which got stuck 2-5 times each cleaning cycle. We regularly go a whole cycle with no getting stuck.\n-- Get the bot boundary tape. It's so much more effective when you use that tape to prevent it from going in all the weird spots where it gets stuck/spins in circles etc.\n\nCONS:\n\n-- the app is super hit and miss. It regularly disconnects. Mostly I forget about the app/using it with Alexa.\n-- it does bop around really randomly. But, again, if at the end of the cycle the drawer is full of hair and dirt, who cares. It cleaned stuff. The pattern was irregular and inefficient. But I didn't have to sweep or vaccum.\n\nThe noise level is so-so. It could be better but I feel like our eufy was worse.",

      "body": "Okay, so my history of seeking out robot vacuums is a long one. Back when I was in college and still lived with my parents, robot vacuums were just starting to come out. My mom had a back injury and I'm disabled - I thought that if we got one of these things it would be a lot easier to keep the house clean. I looked into it, but there was only one big brand at the time, and I had no point of reference for how well they worked since they were such a new thing. They were far too expensive for me to take that chance.\n\nFast forward about 15 years to 2020. At this point it is a well-established technology. I've looked at countless different models over the years, and the price has gone down a lot, but it never seemed like the right time until now. One of the rooms in my current apartment has low pile carpet so I had been looking into these more heavily, as vacuuming every day was becoming tedious.\n\nI was lucky to find this Shark on sale on Amazon and it has been great, apart from the app, which is useless.\n\nThe vacuum itself works wonderfully. It does a great job of cleaning the carpet, which is what I primarily use it for. The carpet always looks so good after I run the Shark. I clean the device out about every other day and I could see it picks up all the dust, hair and particles. I've used it in the other rooms in the apartment with flooring that is laminate as well and it does a good job also. I have no complaints as far as cleaning capability.\n\nCleaning the device out is easy. The pieces were designed to be easily removed and reattached and I have had no problems doing that so far. I'm glad that it’s so simple.\n\nI also like that it is fairly quiet. This is huge because I live in an apartment building and noise is a big concern.\n\nThere was one instance where I did not charge it for like 2 days and the battery didn't die within that span. I was pleasantly surprised. The device is capable of cleaning multiple rooms without losing charge. My apartment is fairly big and there has never been a time it wasn't able to handle it. It has a good battery life.\n\nThe only downside is that the app is useless. It will not connect no matter what I do. This is not a huge issue for me because, as I have said, the vacuum by itself works well, but it I have noticed some small blind spots, so it would be nice to be able to draw the rooms to minimize that.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the device and consider it a good value for what I paid.",

      "body": "I had ordered this as a gift to my mom for Christmas bc she'd been using a handheld vacuum for years. Her home is pretty big, a 2 story home and super spacious so it would take her a long time just to vacuum the floors downstairs. When she opened it, right away we noticed the sleek and shine to the vacuum which was really pretty. No scratches or dents. She used it for the first time in hopes it would pick up dirt in almost every inch of her floor and it did. It wasn't perfect but it definitely did its job, it got in places we couldn't reach. It starts on its own once you program it to start and it puts itself back. It's super easy to take apart and clean. Love this purchase so far that I'm going to buy myself one too.",

      "body": "Overall, I like this vacuum, but it has some quirks. The suction is pretty good (we use the robot vacuum in between deeper vacuum jobs with a regular vacuum), and seems to grab pet hair fairly well. However, it has difficulty transitioning between different types of surfaces -- specifically between rugs and hardwood. It tackles these jobs fine, independently, but if it has to move from a hardwood surface to a rug, it occasionally gets itself under the rug, or bunches up the rug. There are also some cleaning sessions that take an abnormally long time to complete. Usually, it gets our living room and foyer in about 30-40 minutes. However, there are days it will run for over 90 minutes and we'll have to manually send it home.\nOur previous robot vacuum was a Neato (we had it for years before it finally gave out), and we didn't ever have those problems, so these quirks appear to be specific to this Shark vacuum.",

      "body": "This is my 4th robot vacuum, my second Shark. The first two I purchased from Walmart and loved them, but the batteries died and there was no cost effective ways to replace them. They were donated to the local middle school robotics club.\n\nThe Shark has no existing mapping. It just bumps around for hours until I get tired of hearing it (much like my messy loud 11 yr old son). That being said, it vacuums well, even in the most disorganized inefficient way possible.\n\nWe have 4 dogs who shed and mostly hardwood and tile floors. The hair is noticable. I have issues feeling any dirt/hair under my always bare feet, so if I am telling you these work, they do. I schedule it to run every other day much to the chargrin of the dogs.\n\nThe Shark upstairs is self emptying. I recommend getting one like that if you can afford the extra cost. If you can't, this will serve it's purpose although with several annoying characteristics (again no worse than my child). My first two Chinese knockoff vacuums used Lidar/mapping which shark has a model that uses that, I think. Again, spring for that, depending on your finances.\n\nThe durability is left to be determined as I have only had this model for a few weeks.\n\nOverall if you don't have time/energy/desire to vacuum or live with heathens who do not recognize the need for cleaning, you should look into a little helper and relieve your stress on at least one issue.",

      "body": "I bought this to replace another brand that I had a few years ago. I missed my robot vac. LOL\nThis one picks up well, goes over rugs and under most things but it’s super random where it goes. It will enter a room, bump into something and leave. Might go back. Might not. There doesn’t seem to be any obstacle sensors so it literally bumps into EVERYTHING, EVERY TIME.\nIt eventually gets the floors swept (or mostly) but when it bumps into something it doesn’t find it’s way around the thing, it just turns in a completely random direction and goes until it numbs into something else.\nIt may work better with the app but I’m fairly tech savvy and still (after a month of trying) can’t get it to connect. I thought it might be my older iPhone (XR) but recently upgraded to iPhone 15 Plus. Still won’t connect to wi-fi even after multiple times restarting the router, my phone and the vac and starting over. Even deleted the app several times and reinstalled. Nope. It finds the vac but just won’t connect to WiFi.\nSo, overall it sweeps up pet hair and everyday dust well but is very directionally challenged. Seriously, one bump into a wall or table and it will leave the area in a random direction until it bumps into something else.\nAbout as quiet as any other and finds it dock well.\nRight now it’s sweeping the bathrooom AGAIN because it bumped into the hallway wall. Again. 🤦🏼‍♀️",

      "body": "I've always wanted one of these little vacuum robots, and when it was Amazon's deal of the day at $160, I couldn't resist but buy it.\n\nLong story short, I live with 6 other young adult guys in a former convent. The main floor is 3,000 feet and the upstairs is 3,000 feet.\n\nThis lil' shark was not designed for a square footage of this magnitude, but I decided to let him take his best crack at it anyways. First things first...remove ALL MOUSE STICKY TRAPS from your convent and/or home. They catch sharks much more easily than mice. So that was embarrassing. Once all mouse sticky traps were removed, I scheduled the lil' shark to vacuum every night at 1:00 am on the main floor. And vacuum he did. He would occasionally get stuck on wires or other things, but honestly, having observed him for 30 plus minutes, pathetic as he looks sometimes, he can get himself out of many a bind.\n\nSomething to note is that this guy is random (or at least that's the effect). He just bounces around like an idiot. It's amazing he finds his way home at all. However, he's a cheaper model so I don't mind. With the 3,000 square foot main floor, after a week of running every night and bouncing between walls like an air hockey puck, the place started to really look nice. Like, the floors were completely clean and would stay clean. He wouldn't get everything every night, but he didn't have too. He'd get everything eventually throughout the course of a week. The one exception would be the kitchen, but with 7 guys using it multiple times a day, I wouldn't expect lil' sharky to get that every time.\n\nAnother added bonus is all the dust he picks up. That's useful for the air quality in my 70 year old convent.\n\nHis battery life is pretty great, he'll run over two hours every night (partially because he gets lost finding the dock in the massive 3,000 square foot main floor).\n\nTo conclude, for the price, a great lil' helper for your home and/or convent. I wouldn't pay over $275 for him, but very pleased with my purchase. The entertainment value is pretty great as well, watching him pathetically and blindly move about. Great for parties and maintaining conversations with introverts.\n\nOverall: 4.5 Stars",

I suffer from severe fatigue and depression from MS and housework is a struggle for me. The fact I can run it while I'm cleaning the rest of the room is hands down one of the best things. Also being able to walk around without getting crap on my socks/feet and I didn't even have to do anything is super nice. The satisfaction of cleaning all the dirt out after it's done running is fantastic. I have a dog that sheds like crazy and it is a godsend for that.\n\nNow for the cons:\n-she never knows where her home is. Or she'll act like she's going, overshoot it, and add 30 seconds into her landing taking a detour.\n-she can't get in corners. I was super happy to have her get up cat litter (I moved the box up while she ran) and there was a tiny pile in the corner. I just dusted it out in the middle of the room and she got it.\n-it has a lithium ion battery. Those eventually die. She does not charge on the dock unless she is on. It comes with an app so once I see battery replenished I try to turn her off and unplug (I don't always remember, so that's kind of a pain). I alternate between using the app or just the buttons on it. She is compatible with alexa and all that but I don't have one. My friend does and she said voice control did not work great.\n- My dining room is her worst nightmare with chairs and table legs. She almost never makes it back out. They make magnetic strips where you can put up boundaries. I just happen to find the nearest things that she can bounce off of, or move chairs. I wish she had remote control but that would probably add a couple hundred $. There is no mapping with this model, I just run her til I think it's clean enough. There's 3 settings for power.\n- My friend has the exact model, it's the only thing that talked me into it. She has had to replace it once, but the warranty made it easy.\n-The first couple runs you gotta babysit her in case you miss something. I pickup phone cords & dog toys before she runs. I'm also terrified she'll hit dog poo.\n\nI guess I just feel for the price it shouldn't have such a long list of things that I just have to settle with. The thing that made me get it was my best friend has the same exact one. She has had to have hers replaced once so don't skip the warranty!",

He picked up cat litter, hair, and all kinds of stuff! No issues connecting to our internet, and the box came with very specific instructions on GB speeds and whatnot.\n\nI was concerned that it would suck up stuff it wasn’t supposed to, so I enjoyed throwing various cat toys, cords, and stuff in front of it to see what it would pick up, and it didn’t pick up anything it wasn’t supposed to! Cleaning out the dirt and grime collector is so easy too! I clean it out after every run and haven’t had any issues with it overfilling. You may have to pull hair out of the bristles but I expected that as I have to do that with my regular vacuum.\n\nHe has no issues finding the charging dock, and my cats don’t mind him bobbling around our apartment. Even my boyfriend, who told me we don’t need a robot vacuum, loves Optimus Grime and admits it works better than he expected. I love that I can schedule him to go at a specific time of day, or set him loose whenever!\n\nOptimus Grime made it over my rug, bath mats, and my welcome mat!

So, here is my experience, so far\n\n1. Set up should be easy, but both the app and the manual feature an earlier iteration of the product. Hitting the website was of little help. On the app, there is a disconnect between what I ordered (AV752) and the available models to pair with. The manual was no help. I had to rely on my technical prowess (not insubstantial, IMHO) to track down the likely settings;\n\n2. The instructions for resetting (which I needed to do during setup so I could start fresh) are nonexistent, or at least not apparent in the support section of the website.\n\n3. A summary evaluation: The documentation needs updating as it refers to previous versions of the app.\n\nAnd for cleaning? No complaints. The Shark is programmed like your usual robo-vac in it bumps in a semi-random and it's cleaning area is a bit small. It did fine on dust and pet hair.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe dust bin is small and filled quickly and emptying it spilled some of the contents on my clean floor. Dog hair from my black lab wadded up in the bin intake and had to be cleaned out with my fingers. Yuck. I suppose I could have sprung for an automatically emptying model, but I'm cheap.\n\nSo, this is good value for what you get if you can put up with inadequate documentation and figure things out yourself. Patience is a virtue and sometimes, it pays off.",

Shipping was super fast, and setup consists of taking off the tape and snapping on the little brushes.\n\nEveryone names theirs, so it's now deemed \"Bruce\" (shark from Finding Nemo).\nIt was a Black Friday deal for $150 but added the $20 protection plan since my wonderful fiancé has 2 cats and 2 dogs in about 1000 sq ft, so Bruce was doomed to a hard life.\n\nDespite the odds, Bruce is a trooper! WOW!\n\nI've only had to rescue him once from an entangled rug. Loose, light rugs (ie 18\"-36\" little kitchen rugs) tend to get pushed and bunched up, which can trap the wheels rather than just rolling over like he does on the heavier rugs. On heavier/secured rugs, Bruce doesn't care and just climbs from the hardwood onto the rug like a little hiker. If your rug is thick, you'll definitely want to set it to \"max\"--at least for the first couple days. Not sure how well it would do on only carpet, but I still think okay.\n\nUnfortunately he has the directional sense of a lemming and some turn programming makes no sense...but oh well, he'll get there eventually. Probably.\nAnd no, I didn't do the app because it's a vacuum, not a laptop.\n\nThe floors already feel SO much cleaner, which is shocking since I previously vacuumed nearly every day. The only real downside thus far is realizing exactly how much pet dander and hair these critters produce. Accessing the dirt holder is very quick and easy; I was afraid I'd spend more time cleaning the vacuum than if I'd just vacuumed floors myself, but this fear was quickly allayed.\n\nAlso, there's value in an entire evening of free entertainment! We followed it around the house laughing at the cats obsessing over what this new \"creature\" was in the house.\nIt's fairly gentle bumping into the furniture and even bumps into the giant old Labrador, but he'll usually just look at it and go back to sleep.\n\nSeriously, the only better thing I got on the internet was my fiancé.",

Brought this in, set it up in an area I walk past every day for easy access to empty it, and let it charge before running it.\n\nTo be brutally honest, this is not one of those expensive smart vacuums that cleans quietly and following a pattern. This is a happy little robot vacuum without a brain, that will cheerfully burble around in one direction until it bounces off of something, then it will turn and trundle off in another. If you want something that is whisper quiet and has enough of a computer it is methodical about things, this is not the vacuum for you.\n\nThat said, I have yet to have it get stuck on anything it can't get itself out of, and it can do my entire house on one charge. I usually run it once in the morning for an hour or so while I am doing chores, and I toe it on when I get home from work and let it run until the battery runs low. By about day three, I am constantly walking across freshly cleaned floors every time. I have a long haired cat and a great pyrenees who likes to sleep inside with us during the day. There's a lot of hair in my house, and this little thing stays on top of it. I also love that it can clean under the beds so easily!\n\nI will still have to get the big floor vac out once every few weeks to get the corners and behind the furniture, but this little thing is such a lifesaver, and I adore it.",

      "title": "Haphazard Cleaning",
      "body": "GENERAL:\nI toyed with the idea of a robotic vacuum for quite a while but always shied off because of the price(s). When this item was on sale, I thought, \"How bad could it be for this price?\" Though I like my upright Shark vacuum--and used that as a reliability factor--I think I made a mistake. Not a horrible mistake, but...\n\nPRO:\n(1) SUCTION - It does seem to pull things in pretty well--cat hair and various sizes of cat litter (and maybe a stray unpopped popcorn seed).\n(2) TANGLE-FREE - Over my usage--about 2 months--I haven't noticed much of any cat hair buildup around the bristles.\n\nCON:\n(1) ERROR - For the life of me, I can't figure out why it halts as often as it does. (see photo of grey laminate) It just decides to stop and nothing will get it going (you have to pick it up and manually take it back to the dock). Pressing \"Dock\" does nothing. Clearing the error on the app...it still needs to be hauled away. One time, it just stopped in the middle of the floor while returning to the dock. I guess it got lost (although you can see the dock is placed in a nice open area per instructions).\n(2) RANDOM CLEANING - There is no pattern or logic to its cleaning. It bumps into something and it seems to randomly turn in a different direction and goes till it bumps something again. See the photo of the grey carpet and the tracks on it. In other words, it's a crapshoot. And it doesn't matter if you clean a second or a third time, it's all a roll of the dice. It took a fourth cleaning to finally vacuum up a small piece of aluminum foil that was in a particular spot in my kitchen. Sigh... I watched a (funny cat) video of a competing product (that starts with the letter, R, and I noticed it ran a back-and-forth pattern over the carpet (while the cat rode on top). This product does NOT follow any pattern.\n(3) NEVER CONTINUES - My girlfriend has a competing product (that starts with the letter, N). When hers runs out of battery power, it returns to dock, recharges, and then goes back to where it last was and continues the job. This one? LoL. It has to be told to go out and clean and when it does, it has no idea about continuing where it left off--it just randomly goes (cleaning floors it already did), So, as you can tell by item 3 above, it is just a lucky \"roll of the dice\" if it manages to clean everything.\n(4) QUITS EARLY - As you can see on one photo, it is heading to the dock with 40% of the battery left. Sometimes, it heads to the dock with 20%. I guess that is random, too.\n(5) APP - Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I have WiFi extenders throughout my house, I'm retired IT. No way this thing should not be able to find the vacuum wherever. Yet, I have stood beside the darn thing and pressed, \"Clean\", to no avail. I quit using the app. I just walk over to the vacuum and press the Clean button now.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI CANNOT RECOMMEND this product. I decided not to return it (hassle) and I just run it three times a week and hope that is clean enough. Not sure how long the motor will last but I will use it till it dies and maybe it will last a couple of years. Or not.\n\nI use Amazon reviews extensively to make decisions on my purchases. It follows that I should honestly review items that I have liked (or not liked) so as to benefit other Amazon customers (as I would have them do for me). LLBB",

This little shark robot vacuum that my family has affectionately named Mommy Shark is the BEST Mother's Helper I've ever paid for. It doesn't replace all sweeping and vacuuming because it can't reach corners and go through a dining room table/chairs, but she keeps SANITY in my house with 4 kids and 2 pets while we're currently living in a muddy construction area with mud boots, muddy paws, and laminate flooring thoughout the entire house. This machine has been used EVERY SINGLE DAY since I bought it a month and a half ago. If it breaks tomorrow, I already got my money's worth. I don't care if she can find her way back to dock or not. I can put her there myself. I don't care if she drives in an aimless pattern. The important thing is, she picks up a TON of dirt, hair, dust, and debris while I'm busy being a mom all day. My kids are willing to pick up their toys so that Mommy Shark can help sweep the dirt and they will even block off doorways to help keep her confined to specific rooms we actually have picked up lol. It's been a win since day 1 with her. If she dies, I will replace her. Because she's FANTASTIC. If you're a busy mom...just do it. She picks up more than you'd expect and gets stuck less than you'd imagine! And your kids will think she's as fun as you do!",

This model works great and works hard. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the lower functionality compared to the newer upgraded models. This vacuum basically just roams the house bouncing back and forth in zig zag patterns, it does not map the house or go row by row. It does however surprisingly do a pretty good job. Good enough that we ended up wanting another vacuum and went with the newer fancier model that maps rooms and cleans in rows. I think this is a great version to see if you’re going to like a robot vacuum and to test it out in your house. Ours kept up with a toddler and a dog who sheds no problem. Transitions from carpet to hardwood with no issue. One complaint is that it isn’t that smart and gets stuck in the same places (especially under desks with cords) so you will have to figure out ways around that. Good product. Would recommend.",

This does exactly what everyone says… it just bounces around aimlessly… if you lock it in a room with nothing on the floor, sure it works great, but leaving it on the schedule I come home to see it constantly getting stuck. If I am not home I won’t use it because of this issue and it defeats the purpose to me. I could just vacuum and do a better job in a smaller time frame. I have 3 pets so was hoping to decrease the amount I’m vacuuming daily… didn’t care about the lack of self emptying as it’s not hard to empty the thing and it does pick up a lot… just isn’t a smart robot and I was definitely spoiled by the other one (with home mapping features and smart features like avoiding obstacles) I’ll say it did help the other day locking it in each room to vacuum before I mopped but otherwise it’s just that…. Entry level.\n\nUpdate: I emptied the bin for the first time and holy crap Did it pick up a ton of animal hair etc. but after a couple weeks of using it it’s already squeaking quite a bit in the wheels. Not sure if this is gonna be an issue…. Definitely picking up a ton though so that’s a plus.",

So much so that after contacting tech support they walked through additional steps which none still were helpful. They even then escalated my issue higher up and said I would get a call back because of large queue. I never got a call back.

It was a huge hit and she raved anytime I asked about it. After finally admitting my own defeat at keeping my house clean with two kids, a cat, a dog and a less-than-cleanly husband, I bought myself one as well.\n\nFirst, I have no idea what folks are talking about with connectivity issues or noise level of the machine. Make sure you have 2.4ghz network available as indicated otherwise I could see the headache. For me, it about 5 min to download app, connect to WiFi and link to Alexa. I haven't tried Alexa control yet so can't speak to that.\n\nMs. Sharky went to town cleaning my disgusting floors. Yes, she bumped into everything and yes, she starts off randomly zipping here and there but I have picked her up and put her in different rooms and she seems to be improving on every run. To her credit, she always makes it back to her dock. She does get stuck around the wheels of my computer chair and desk sometimes but to be expected. I am so very very confused about folks complaining about the noise. She is significantly quieter than the regular Dyson vacuum and you can have phone conversations, watch tv, etc. My family always complains about vacuuming noise and nobody said a single word about it while she ran. It's a vacuum, if it is silent, I wouldn't trust it. After doing about 7 runs in 3 days (yes, my house is gross thank you), she started making a loud siren-y blaring noise. Cleaned the filter with an old dry toothbrush and the filter screen and boom, back to normal. I figure once my floors are actually maintained, I won't have to clean the filter so soon. If your vacuum is loud, maybe do a good good clean on the filter.\n\nAnd let's talk about those floors.. whew. That bin is nasty and it is satisfying. She even cleans the medium-pile shag with ease. Does she get every little corner? Not yet and maybe never. Does she replace a regular vacuum? No. But my floors are *noticeably* cleaner and she has eliminated my twice-a-day sweep of the mostly hardwood floors. There are no tuffs of fur dancing in the hallway. I love you dearly, Ms. Sharky.",

After a hard sell from my 83 year neighbor (we started calling him the rum*** salesman) I decided that because Amazon had a good return policy I ought to give it a try. I bake and often my house seems dusted with a fine coat of flour so I must dust, sweep, vacuum, mop almost daily. I also live a couple of miles from a grain elevator...this 50 year old house can get VERY dusty.\nShe is uber easy to set up. It is not uncommon for me to attempt assembly without first reading the instructions, but this time it really was hardly necessary. I initially had her set up in a low traffic area against the wall about 4 feet behind/facing a sofa. I’m not sure why, but she had difficulty navigating. Now she is set up against a wall with 8 ft of clearance in the front, about 4 ft on one side and 2.5 on the other. She is set to vacuum on Max at 3am. This portion of the house is 1600 square feet, with lots of furniture and lots of baking. No carpet but large area rugs in 4 of 5 rooms and she has had no difficulty. She has run for as long 2.5 hours as briefly as 1 hour. 2.5 hours after a very messy day baking. In addition to the clean floors the whole place is not as dusty. Not sure why...does she suck it from the air?? I think so?? The first week or so she seemed embarrassing full. Now she gets more than I’d expect but just a fraction of the first weeks. I just don’t know where she finds the stuff! I have put her in the back of the house which is a medium pile carpet. She worked well but not as well as the hard surfaces. She also got under a bed and could get back out and that was a problem.\nI’ve only had her for a month so I can’t speak to the long term use or wear and tear. I am VERY happy with this purchase and My Rosie truly has improved my life. I have just been running a damp mop through the kitchen and she does the rest!!

Works amazing on our hardwood floors and rugs. We have two mini Himi- Persians and they shed. This picks up more than our large vacuum. I love how it goes under all our furniture to get those little dust bunnies hiding. I love setting up the schedule and not worrying about it. It is super easy to clean and the collection bin holds a lot. Save yourself some time vacuuming and get one. It is a little pricey but it does pay you back. It saves your back from running that big old Vacuum!",

      "title": "Basic",
      "body": "As a vacuum, it's functional! Sucked up all the right things, it DOES get stuck sometimes and you have to go kick it around but it's sure enough not intuitive enough to go in a pattern that provides coverage (linear or zig-zag) of a room. Kind of goes in a random pattern in a large space until it encounters an obstacle or gets stuck. Had a corner with kitty litter that needed to be cleaned and while it did go in that direction after some nudging, it passed through the area of litter once and left the corner...with the rest of the litter still there. Like I said, not intuitive but at this price point you're still going to have to kick it around to \"guide\" it to the right spots. Mind you, I have a very open space apartment with minimal furniture for it to get stuck on--so too much furniture being in the way was not the issue in my case.\n\nI returned my unit because the app no longer listed my model (AV751) and provided incorrect setup instructions (it said to \"press and hold the 'Clean' & 'Dock' button to put into Wi-Fi setup mode\" BUT for the AV751 model, the correct way is to press and hold the 'Dock' and 'Max' button) and I couldn't get the device to connect to my Wi-Fi network after several tries. It is safe to say that the AV751 is an older model of the current RV750 in which the app does provide (current) instructions for setup.\n\nI didn't think I'd desire the Wi-Fi functionality so much as long as it cleaned well BUT I would've liked the option to have some semblance of control since this vacuum likes to wander aimlessly until I kick it into a room I needed it to be in. Great as a basic robot vacuum, but I'd opt for a cheaper alternative of what this unit offers because you have a 50/50 chance to get it to connect to the app!",

I think that it is one of the best purchases you can make as a pet owner. The price was also great compared to some of the other robot vacuums. I set it on a schedule that I can adjust on my phone, and having access to run the vacuum when I’m away or just a hands free perspective is so convenient! I would definitely recommend this to everyone.",

I have loads of furniture, dining room tables, chairs, couches, etc and floor to carpets and so far so great. The only reason for the 4 star rating and not 5 was the wifi connectivity with the app. I spend hours trying what they said it but never worked. The first problem was my model wasn't in the app. (Shark better update the app for future improved ratings). So I chose the model that looked closest to mine. The the app said to push the Clean & Dock buttons..... didn't work. I tried everything they said on troubleshooting at least 5 times. So then I quit. Next day I did what my step-son always does..... go to YouTube and search what others are saying to do. Finally, I learned on YouTube to push the Dock & Max buttons and it connected to the wifi and all is peaceful in the house. I hate when technology doesn't work and the item is NEW. GRRR. Hope this helps others.",

The bristle brushes like to pop off though and if you don’t know where it happened good luck finding! So order some back ups. I usually empty every two days because we keep our place relatively clean and not super large home. But I do not regret this purchase! Totally beats vacuuming everyday on your own when a robot does it for you! We have used for a month now and the I would say for running everyday for about an hour an 15 min the charge holds up. The cliff sensors work when you have two level home and going by stairs. It does get stuck on stupid things, recommend if you have loose rugs to remove during cleaning or block off cleaning spot(I think they make strips you can put around areas you want the vac to avoid). We have it connected to our google home and I would give the app 5 out of 10 stars. Its pretty much useless other than notifying you when its stuck. All in all I am pleased to not vacuum myself 👍",

      "body": "I've had this for about 1.5 years. I have a dog and 2 cats and very messy children. This little guy handles everything like a champ. He is not super efficient - I'm pretty sure I could vacuum the house significantly faster than he does - but I can turn him on and essentially ignore him while i do something else, until he gets stuck or full (usually every 30 minutes or so). He's very gentle too - he comes right up my dog's tail (my dog is old, blind, and *over it* so he doesn't even move out of the way) and doesn't hurt him at all. But he cleans up everything from Christmas tree pine needles to hair and fur to pieces of foam or cardboard that my cat scratched up to *all the crumbs* - and he does it on carpet or hard surfaces just as well. When he gets hair or a cord wrapped around his various parts, it's really easy to pull off the relevant part, remove the hair, and he's back to work. He's an adventurer and likes to go under or over anything he can, so i make sure to block off anything that could be dangerous (i.e. stairs), but I do love how persistent he is at getting under any furniture he fits under. After he's done, the house looks great! He's also fun to watch (unfortunately I have not convinced either of my cats to go for a ride) and makes only a mild amount of vacuum noise. I *highly* recommend based on value, durability, ease of maintenance, and effectiveness. One of my favorite purchases ever!",

      "body": "This was my first robot vacuumed I have ever tried so I started on with a basic model just in case it wasn't up to all the hype. It was really easy to setup and get connected to wifi. Although the wifi connection was a little spotty now and then and the app couldn't find the robot at times, I couldn't complain for the price. The first time I ran it I couldn't believe how much dirt, dust and dog hair it pulled out of my carpet even after a recent vacuuming with my regular vacuum. I was happily amazed! The only downside at that time was that I didn't opt for the Shark with the automatic dumping feature and the waste bin. Fast forward 6 months..... All of the sudden in the middle of the night I keep hearing a strange beeping noise in the other room. I go in there to find Sharkie on his charging dock beeping away with lights flashing. Even if I turn off the switch it still beeps until I take it off the charger. After going through all of the trouble shooting steps trying to figure out what all the warning lights mean, I couldn't figure it out. So I called Shark and they have a call back support where they contact you the next day. After being on the phone with the support person (who was very nice) she reluctantly mentioned that they have seen a lot of issues with these Shark vacuums lately. After going through the trouble shooting process she said they will have to send me out \"some new parts\" and I will have to swap them out and pay for the shipping both ways even though I was within the 1 year warranty period. When said and done the cost of shipping the parts is almost 1/2 of what the robot costs now. Not to mention I have to swap the parts out. Not the best warranty in this industry I'm sure. All and all I still gave the Sharkie a 3 star rating because when it did work....it did a great job cleaning. Maybe the next person that reads this and still orders one will have better luck.",

We added a second dog to our household about a year ago, and I could no longer keep up with the pet hair -- this has been the perfect solution. It gets an A rating for suction and overall clean. It get's a B for run time -- we live in a 1000 sq ft apartment, so if you live in a larger home, I would opt for something with a longer runtime. It also gets a B rating on the size of the internal debris capture -- it's not very big and fills up quickly, we have to empty it daily, but also see that as a good sign that it's doing the best it can per run.\n\nOverall really great and dependable option. I also wanted to add that we have a lot of obstacles/furniture in our home and it's been able to navigate around those tight areas and onto rugs/carpet rather seamlessly.",

I fully expected that I would be returning it after its failed attempt at tackling the DNA left on the floors by two dogs and three cats, not to mention the very plush carpet that has broken down even the toughest of upright vacuum cleaners. But, after almost two months of daily cleaning, it has exceeded our expectations. Does it replace a good weekly vacuuming? Not in our house. But to have something that can keep up with the daily shedding and normal dirt that comes in - this really does a good job. It’s also not terribly noisy, and it doesn’t bother our Australian Shepherd who despises the big vacuum. We were initially worried that she would try and “herd” this vacuum, but she tends to ignore it and just move away if it gets too close. Things to keep in mind if you are considering it: It takes a couple weeks to “learn” your house, so those initial cleanings do take longer. If you have stairs going to the basement with nothing blocking them - it’s going to get hung up there once in awhile. Sometimes it gets stuck on a floor vent or on the corner of a throw rug, but that happens less than the stair issue. You will have to take out the brush roller once or twice a week and remove the hair from it. It also has two filters (very easy to remove) that will need to be rinsed out every couple of weeks. Overall, I would say this has been a very good purchase.",
