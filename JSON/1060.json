They are so lightweight and comfortable, if you could walk on a cloud, the cloud would be called Hey Dude! I was worried about the sizing since all shoes fit differently. Based on other reviews that said these run big, I sized down and I‚Äôm so glad I did! I would suggest following the directions and measuring your feet with a tape measure. My feet are just under 9‚Äù and the 6 is perfect. I normally wear a 6 1/2 or 7 depending on the shoe. I should mention that my left foot is a half size bigger than my right. So I always have to get a half size bigger otherwise my left foot will be crammed. This is not the case here. While my right foot definitely has more room, my left foot doesn‚Äôt feel cramped at all. So if you are in between sizes, definitely size down. I got the sunset pink color and they are so pretty! I love the turquoise inner lining! If you have to sell a kidney, get them. If you have to sell a child, get them. If you have to take out a loan, get them. Just do it. You won‚Äôt be sorry! Definitely recommend this brand and style!",

If you can sound like Batman himself, do it. Even if you can‚Äôt do anything at all, do this. All jokes aside, these are perfect.",

The lightweight nature of these is another huge bonus. I liked them so much I will def get a second pair soon. The only thing about them you need to be aware of is they are made of breathable fabric so the wind cuts right through. They are not made for winter or wet environments. Still 5 stars for me though.\n\nIve only had these a few days but they seem to be comfortable and they fit well after I readjusted the knots to kind of tighten the top. There is enough room for insoles if I want those too, so I am buying a second pair in another color.",

Reviews awesome so I tried them. I thought the white sole against the black canvas would look too \"old\" but it really doesn't once you put them on. It does take some time to become the most comfortable shoes you own. When I first wore these they hurt. I wear a 10.5 and went with a 10 based on some reviews saying they stretch. They do and they did and are now very, very comfortable. People stop me to ask where I bought them, which surprised me. I am back here to buy more and I do still wish they had a shoe that I think is more fashionable, but I'm still buying more. Several more. Enjoy these. They're great.",
