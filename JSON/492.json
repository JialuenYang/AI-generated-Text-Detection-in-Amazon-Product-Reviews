We have zero issues with the filter or lid. Size is perfect for a child to use for independence and adult to pour a full glass of water as well. It didn’t take long at all either to refil the pitcher. Would purchase again if we find ourselves needing a second one",

It could be my imagination, but it bothered me so much, that I broke down and bought this Brita. The pitcher is strong, not flimsy, as it has been reported to be. It is attractive when left on the counter. It is easy to fill, you just open the top, and gently hold it open for a second, and it will stay open. The water filters fast! I love my water again! I keep the pitcher in the refrigerator for very cold, refreshing water.\n\nThe only thing I would change would be to get the larger pitcher. I bought the 6 cup, which is fine. But, when we get a refrigerator with more room, I will buy a larger Brita pitcher. I am just happy to have such clean water. Even our dog seems to be drinking more water!

That is our drinking water. This pitcher is our \"cooking/Keirig/cat dish/everything else\" water.\n\nAnd to tell the truth... this has ended up being much easier on us than the PUR filter installed on the faucet as before. To fill our Keirig (which is often), we just grab our Brita picture, walk over, and fill our coffee maker! Before, we had to get a pitcher or bowl, wait for the PUR to do it's thing, then carry it over to our coffee bar to use it, then we'd have to put the pitcher or bowl in the dish drainer to air dry.\n\nWhich of the two seems simpler to you?",

I find this to be acceptable for one person, I drink 2 pitchers of filtered water every day. It’s convenient that 1 pitcher closely equals my 40 ounce tumbler. I used Brita when they originally cane out and don’t know what’s different but it does seem that the water has a slight taste whereas originally, Brita pitchers pretty much removed all taste from my tap water. It might just be that my tap water is that bad now.\n\nIt’s very easy and quick to put a new filter in and toss out the first couple of pitchers. It does a decent job of filtering out chlorine and other yucky tap water taste. I do think some brands of bottled water taste better but I love not having to buy bottled water anymore, the Brita allows me to drink tap water which I cannot stomach unfiltered and I save a lot of money as well as help the environment.\n\nA good buy that I am happy with. I see no issues with the design,I very slightly underfill it and it filters quickly and I fill my tumbler and recill the pitcher and put it in the fridge for my refill later in the day. This size will not work for a family but is perfect for just me. The filters are convenient and easy to find and a breeze to replace. I don’t think the indicator light is necessary and I could do without that feature but if Brita wants an indicator to light up on my pitcher lid, okay then!\n\nI recommend this, everyone needs to drink more water..",

I really like the indicator light feature, also this smaller pitcher is quite heavy when full. So glad I didn't get the larger one.

And I really bought it to filter my ferrets water, so I didn’t need it to hold a lot. It holds 2-24oz cups worth of water. One thing I don’t like about it is that the little flap that you lift up to fill it, falls down super easily while you are trying to fill it. This has resulted in me getting water all over on the little display and presumably where the battery is located.
