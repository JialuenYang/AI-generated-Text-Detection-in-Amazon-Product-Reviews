This shampoo has surpassed my expectations in numerous ways, and I'd like to share why I believe it's such a remarkable product:\n\nEfficient Residue Removal: This shampoo is a game-changer when it comes to removing residue from my hair. After each wash, my hair feels incredibly clean, soft, and refreshed. It truly lives up to the promise of purifying the hair.\n\nNourishing Formula: What sets Garnier Fructis Pure Clean apart is its infusion of aloe extract, Vitamins B3 & B6. Not only does it cleanse effectively, but it also hydrates and nurtures my hair, leaving it healthy and vibrant. The best part? There's no heavy, greasy feeling â€“ just clean, revitalized strands.\n\nVersatile and Gentle: It's gentle enough for daily use and suitable for all hair types. Whether I'm washing my hair every day or just a few times a week, I can depend on this shampoo to provide a consistent and reliable clean.\n\nEco-Friendly Commitment: I appreciate Garnier's commitment to Greener Beauty. The use of 100% Recycled Plastic for their bottles is a step in the right direction to reduce environmental impact. It's heartening to see a brand dedicated to sustainable practices.\n\nFree from Harsh Chemicals: The fact that this shampoo is paraben-free and silicone-free is a significant advantage. It gives me peace of mind, knowing that I'm not subjecting my hair to harsh or unnecessary chemicals.\n\nCruelty-Free and Vegan: The Leaping Bunny certification and vegan status further highlight Garnier's commitment to ethical and cruelty-free practices. It's a reassuring aspect for conscientious consumers like myself.\n\nIn conclusion, Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Purifying Shampoo is a remarkable addition to my hair care routine. Its efficient residue removal, nourishing formula, and eco-friendly commitments make it a top choice. I've experienced fantastic results, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in search of a reliable, eco-conscious shampoo that leaves hair clean, soft, and revitalized. Garnier's dedication to purity, sustainability, and ethical practices truly shine through in this product. Your hair will thank you for it!",

It weighs my hair down and I'm left with no bounce and a somewhat slimy feel.\n\nMy hair is normal and there's a lot of it. My scalp can get oily on occasion. My hair does not get very dry. I rarely wash my hair every day. I don't color my hair, so it doesn't have chemical damage. All I need is a decent clean so I can condition as needed, if needed, and use a leave-in oil product to impart some shine.\n\nI've used this shampoo a number of times, thinking maybe it was me or an odd day, but it just isn't working for me. This would probably be best used by someone with dry hair/scalp who wants to clarify gently. Even better if your hair is also frizzy. This might be perfect for you.\n\nIt just leaves my hair a little too soft and mushy, and a little too tamed.\n\nIt's well-priced and worth a try.

It would be a five star review at a brick and mortar store, but a 4 star review as purchased through Amazon. The only reason is because the bottle leaks. Even if the cap never gets dislodged, unless the bottle is shipped in a vertical position all the way through the shipping process (which is unlikely), the shampoo inside will seep out. Sometimes, the bottle will be wrapped in its own plastic bag if shipped in a box with other purchases, but often times it will not be. For this reason, the shampoo is no longer in my subscribe and save orders, which often includes food packages that I don't want to be permeated with shampoo - think baking flours, cacao powder, etc.\n\nThe workaround that works for me is to try to ensure that this product is only shipped with other mild cleansing products - such as other shampoos, soaps, liquid dishwashing detergents. If this is part of your subscribe and save delivery, do not include products you intend to consume unless the package can be safely rinsed off. If you order this with other items, select a different delivery method for just the shampoo if possible i,e, if you have Prime, perhaps you select 2-day shipping for the shampoo and free Amazon day delivery for the rest of your order.\n\nI will continue to order the product, because I like the product and the price is reasonable compared to what you would pay elsewhere.",

It really doesnâ€™t strip your hair at all like I was expecting, just makes it feel clean and perfect. Iâ€™m sick over the fact that I used to spend $50 for a bottle of shampoo only for my hair to feel disgusting.",

It's clear. It smells good not strong or like * man* shampoo. A little bit goes a long way.\nThis is good to use a few times every 10 days in-between your higher-end salon shampoo, if you're one of those ppl like us who wash your hair every other day.\nThis might be good for ppl with oily hair who wash more often. We used a clarifying one, by Kendra. Was clear and smelled like grapefruit. I like this one a little better.\nThe price can't be beat and it is awesome.",
