			"title": ">>> DOES THE JOB",
			"body": "> MUSIC QUALITY – The sound-quality of music using the Sony MDREX15LP is very good – with typical earbud base. That’s just a matter of physics, earbud drivers are simply to small to produce good base. (\"Base boosted\" earbuds produce louder base (which smothers the high- and mid-tones), but \"loud\" (lacking any detail) is not the same thing as \"good\"). Suggestion, use the earbuds when you are out, but purchase a Sony ZX headphone set for listening to music at home -- and enjoy the base.\n> VOICE QUALITY – Clean, clear and crisp in the voice-range, without fiddling with an equalizer – largely because the base is poor. So these (or similar) earbuds are clearly the choice for listening to audiobooks, podcasts, talking on your phone, etc. Listening to music, with base-rich music, can be very enjoyable -- but Sony ZX headphones produce far better base than any brand of earbuds, at any price.\n> Loud vs efficient. Sony MDREX15LP earbuds are very efficient --- the volume is loud at low volume settings -- not TOO loud, there is plenty of room for adjustment, but louder than many other earbuds and louder than most headsets, at the same volume settings. Practically speaking, \"efficient\" means that the earbuds do not drain the battery on your battery-operated device as quickly. \"Efficient\" is a good thing. Also, if you pay attention, you can usually lower the volume, and the sound quality will be just as good -- and your battery will last longer. Always play music at the lowest setting that you can hear well. Or you can crank up the volume and plan on being deaf by the time you are 50 --- 40 if you use garbage \"base-boosted\" earbuds.\n> EXERCISE, ETC – Stays in place better than most earbuds. But, if you engage in strenuous exercise, consider Panasonic ErgoFit, which fit deeper in your ear. The down side of the Panasonic ErgoFit is that they fit so securely that it is difficult to get them out of your ear quickly, to answer a phone, etc.\n> SYMMETRY – The Sony MDREX15L are close to being bilaterally symmetrical – It doesn’t really matter if you put the put the left earbud in your right ear, etc. However, the Panasonic ErgoFit are not, they fit deeper into the ear, and are shaped differently to match your right and left ear canals. It can take a while to get used to inserting the right Ergofit earbud into your right ear, and the left into the left.\n> ISOLATION – All truly in-the-ear earbuds, with cup-shaped rubber cushions, are good at reducing outside noise, better than headphones – often good enough for air travel (depending on the aircraft and the location of your seat). Many earbud brands claim to feature “noise cancellation” but do not actually have any noise cancellation circuitry. Passive isolation (such as provided by the Sony MDREX15LP earbuds), is NOT noise cancellation. Feedback reduction (on wi-fi earbuds with microphones) is often called noise cancellation, but isn't. Beware that while true noise cancellation works moderately well for aircraft engines (and similar sounds), it doesn’t work at all for screaming children or random noise. If your earbuds feel loose in your ear, you may need to install large cushions on the earbuds, to get them to seal in your ear canal good enough to provide good isolation.\n> COMFORT – The secret to comfort when using earbuds is to use the smallest cushions which work for you. Three sets, small, medium, and large are included with the Sony MDREX15LP earbuds. You might be most comfortable with smaller cushions. It a can also take a while to build up tolerance. So, if earbuds hurt your ears, build up slowly wearing them a little longer each day. It can take weeks to get to the point that you can wear them all day long without pain. Changing, or replacing, earbud cushions is easy -- just pull the cushion off, and push the new one (or cleaned one) back on.\n> PLUG – The plug is angled, at 90 degrees, unfortunately. If you pull on the cord, you won't easily pull the plug out the socket, but you will put on strain on the cord (where the cord attaches to the plug), and potential damage it. In my experience, this is how most headphones fail.\n> PACKAGING – The Sony MDREX15LP earbuds that I purchased came in wonderful frustration–free packaging — in a small plastic bag in a small easy-to-open cardboard box. But, I can’t promise that you won’t get a horrible retail anti-theft pack. Amzn used to promote and feature frustration-free packaging -- but, sadly, doesn't anymore.\n> SLEEPING – The Sony MDREX15L don’t stick out as far as some other brands, and so, may be more comfortable when resting with your head to the side (or inside a helmet). Panasonic ErgoFit fit deeper in the ear, and are a little more comfortable in such situations. APTEK offers a nice earbud set for sleeping that is even smaller–but the cushion is built-in, so you can’t choose the cushion size. However, even with the APTEKs, I cannot comfortably sleep with an earbud in the ear that is on the pillow. My solution – I just use one earbud in the ear that is NOT on the pillow. In fact, I recycle earbud sets where one earbud has failed, by cutting the failed earbud off, and using the working earbud, shifting the earbud from ear to ear if I change sides.\n> TIP – CLEANING EARBUDS – The build up of earwax is a serious problem. It can actually muffle and distort or block the sound, and when it gets that bad, effective cleaning is difficult or impossible. The best and simplest strategy is to take a look at your earbuds every few days, and vigorously scratch/flick the open hole of the cushion several times. That breaks loose the wax into flakes, which you can then just blow away. Wiping (such as with a Q-tip) doesn’t work so well (unless you take the cushions off, clean them, and reinstall them), because wiping with a Q-tip may just grind wax into the little screen in front of the speakers, which is then impossible to clean. Caveat, Sony MDREX15L earbud cup-cushions are a slightly different shape from other brands, with a smaller hole, and seems to collect less earwax -- even so, regularly checking and clearing earwax is a good thing to do.",

Well this time they broke and I figured, these have a warranty, why don't I use it. Sure these things are only about ten bucks or so but over the years I've bought at least ten of these. That cost adds up.\nSo, I called Sony to make a warranty claim. The person I talked to was polite and professional. She told me that I could get a replacement after I sent in my broken set and uploaded a copy of the receipt. She said as soon as they received my uploaded copy of my receipt, they would send me a shipping label.\nSo after hanging up the phone with her, I checked my email and there was an email from Sony Service and Support. It had my case number and a link to follow to upload my receipt. Well, I tried to upload my receipt and it failed repeatedly. The website responded \"Error - no file attached\" or something to that effect.\nA week later I get a message:\n\"Thank you for contacting Sony regarding the warranty of your MDREX15AP/W. Unfortunately, we did not receive the proof of purchase and therefore, your case has expired.\"\n\nSadly, this is not the first time Sony has let me down. Many years ago I had a professional DVCAM camera I used for shooting various things and the CCD went out while I was in the middle of a job. I shipped it to Sony to have it repaired and when I got it back I made the mistake of not verifying the work had been correctly. This camera went on the self for a few months and when I needed to use it, it couldn't hold focus. I called Sony and they said I waited to long to call them about this issue. The repair was not under warranty. So I paid several hundred dollars for a repair that wasn't done right on a camera that I paid $8,000 for. I'm done with Sony.",

I would wear these headphones for running, excising, walking, and going about my day. And I just find myself fussing with them more than my old MDR-AS210, which had a rubber loop that gripped my ears (and were more comfortable).\n\nWhile these headphone would be great for sitting and working on a project (and still a great low price for headphones), I wouldn't recommend for listening to your tunes and podcasts on the go.\n\nInstead spend a little more money (or go on eBay for the other headphones) on headphones that won't be these fussy.",

			"body": "Pros\n-Well balanced audio\n-Variety of Colors\n-Lightweight\n-Cable does not tangle\n-Durable\nCons\n-Design is plain\n-Earbuds might be too small\nShould You Buy:YES\nActual Value:$20\n\nAs a high school student (and college), I tend to listen to music almost anywhere I go. But almost all the time, I end up destroying them or losing them. Headphones usually suffer a lot of abuse wherever I use them. However, these earbuds are perfect for college students on a budget who want the best balance of audio and build quality.\n\n-Design-\nThere isn’t anything particularly interesting of these earbuds. The design is plain, but functional. On a positive note, it does come in a variety of colors to chose from, The cable has a line texture that helps it from tangling up. Everything else also feels durable and it doesn’t look like it’ll fail anytime soon. Overall, it’s more of a conservative look rather than a boring look.\n\n-Performance-\nThe audio quality is balanced. There is an even amount of bass and treble and it doesn’t feel like one overpowers the other. It has excellent clarity and most music sounds balanced and good, although bass might not be enough if your playlist consist mostly of rap and rock. Overall, it’s a good compromise and good quality music. I don’t usually use the mic, but it does hold up well and it does get my voice clear during a phone call.\n\n-Quality\nThese earbuds really hold up well with the abuse I typically have with them. I’ve had these for 2 months and I have an older pair for a year and they still sound and look great. This really is the best if you want cheap headphones that will not break easily.\n\n-Conclusion-\nOverall, these headphones are my top pick if I need to buy some for exercising or commuting. The audio quality is good and balanced as well and being reliable. I would consider the Skullcandy Ink’d 2 as strong competition, but based on my past experience, they don’t last and will break soon. JVC Gumy are also reliable and have a unique design, but the audio quality is slightly under the Sony. Overall, when it comes down to my money, I’d rather spend it on these headphones. They are simply that good.",

I even gaslit myself and tried all the different sized earbud tips they provided to see if that would change anything (as if that was even possibly a reason). This might be a reasonable purchase if you needed earphones if you were traveling for a week or so, but not for extended use in front of your computer setup or anything like that.\n\nI figured Sony's brand and the 4-star rating was guarantee enough but these are earphones are dirt cheap meant to be built at cents per unit and sold slowly to just passively accrue revenue.

They tend to be small enough that they don't hurt my ears when I roll on my side, as much as other larger ear buds tent to do. They also seem to have pretty good passive noise cancellation, as long as you have the right sized cap on the earbuds to fit into your ear properly.\n\nI bought this pair because my last replacement pair lost the right connection at some point. I finally got around to replacing those and bought these. They aren't the same EXACT ones as my last, as those are discontinued, but these are pretty close. I might have to put a different sized cap on the buds, as the ones that came on seem a bit too big maybe. It's a tight fit, maybe too tight, and I don't get a good enough seal to block as much noise as the previous pair. Even still, they do block some noise, so I'm happy with them.

I ultimately decided that my best option was a fair sounding, not necessarily the best sounding, fairly well made but not so expensive earbuds would be my best option.
