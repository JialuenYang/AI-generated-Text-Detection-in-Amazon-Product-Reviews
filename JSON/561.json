      "body": "I purchased these 14k gold solitaire stud earrings for my 4-year-old daughter, and they have been a fantastic purchase. The screw-back design is perfect, as my daughter used to lose the backs of her earrings before. The size of the studs is just rightâ€”not too small, not too big, but the perfect size for her. They are comfortable for her to wear daily and do not irritate her ears or cause any pain. She wears them every day without any issues, and I am thrilled to have finally found the perfect pair of earrings for her. I highly recommend these earrings to anyone looking for a beautiful, comfortable, and secure option for their child.",
