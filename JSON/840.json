			"body": "I purchased the ADISEN Shatterproof Full-Length Wall Mirror Tiles with high hopes but ended up with a mixed experience. On the positive side, the concept of shatterproof mirrors is reassuring, and the size of the tiles was suitable for my space. However, the major drawback was their inability to adhere well to the wall. Despite following the installation instructions diligently, the tiles just didn't want to stick securely, making the overall installation process frustrating.\n\nAdditionally, the mirror reflection quality left something to be desired. The clarity and sharpness were not up to my expectations, and I noticed some distortion, especially towards the edges. It was disappointing as I had hoped for a crisp and clear reflection.\n\nWhile the shatterproof feature is commendable, the challenges with adhesion and mirror quality bring my rating down to three stars. If improvements are made in the adhesive aspect and mirror clarity, these tiles could be a more compelling option.",
