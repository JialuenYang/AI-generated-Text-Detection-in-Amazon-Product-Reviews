It's like I'm shaving with a tiny, well-oiled acrobat! Every stroke feels like a juggling act, hoping my razor doesn't do a backflip and land on my nose.\n\nIn all seriousness, this shave gel has become my secret weapon for starting the day. It's a fantastic product that keeps my face silky smooth and razor burn to a minimum. I used regular shave cream/gel for years and will never go back.\n\nDisclaimer: No penguins were harmed in the making of this review.",
