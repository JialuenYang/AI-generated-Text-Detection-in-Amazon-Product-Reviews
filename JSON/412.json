      "title": "Lack of Rigid Structure Leaves Me Slouching in Disappointing Back Brace",
      "body": "When my back pain flared up recently, I hoped this adjustable back brace would provide some much-needed lumbar support. However, the fairly flimsy build left more to be desired.\n\nUnlike rigid braces made from firm plastics and stabilizing rods, this product from HealthCom relies primarily on stretchy neoprene material with velcro straps for tightening. While comfortable against the skin, it lacks adequate structure to actually improve posture.\n\nI could fasten the velcro quite snugly around my mid and upper back. But unfortunately the brace still allowed too much unwanted slouching and bending. It simply doesn't have the unyielding support needed to train better alignment or offer soothing compression.\n\nBoth the shoulder straps and abdomen belt are also thinly padded without robust reinforcement. Over time they stretched out further reducing any hints of proper posture cuing.\n\nFor the affordable price point, I can't say I'm surprised by the performance. But those with serious posture needs or harsh back pain should invest in a heavier-duty brace with more rigid support. The HealthCom model is too lightweight and flimsy to be considered adequate reinforceent.\n\nIn the end, the minimal support left me continuing the search for a more sturdy and truly corrective back brace option. This might help very temporarily improve comfort but won't deliver lasting results.",
