			"body": "⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nThe 100 pcs Compressed Facial Mask Sheets are a great addition to my skincare routine. I appreciate the natural cotton material and the convenience of having them individually wrapped.\n\nThese masks work wonderfully for creating my own customized masks at home. I've found that cutting off the nose section after applying allows for a better fit around the eyes.\n\nThe bonus of receiving a small mask bowl, mask brushes, and a hairband for free is a nice touch and adds value to the purchase.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of these compressed facial mask sheets. They provide a cost-effective way to indulge in DIY skincare treatments at home, and I would recommend them to others looking to elevate their skincare routine.",
