      "body": "We have wanted a Ring Video Camera Doorbell for some time. Black Friday provided us with the perfect opportunity to acquire one at a very reasonable price. Bundled with the Echo Show 5 (3rd Generation) made our investment all the more rewarding. This Video Camera Doorbell works great! Imo, the 1080p HD wired video quality is exceptional. Audio is great too. It is paired to a family member's cell phone so when out of the house, we may still monitor what is happening at our front door. The Video Camera Doorbell is also paired to the Echo Show 5, assisted by Alexa, making in home monitoring convenient and enjoyable. Our original purpose for investing in a Ring Video Camera Doorbell was to enhance our home security. A family member recommended the Echo Show 5 as it was on sale during Black Friday at an irresistible price, especially bundled with the Doorbell Video Camera. Needless to say, the Echo Show 5 and Alexa afford so much more than alerting us to what is happening at our front door. There are microphones so one may converse with whomever may be there if desired. And then ..... one may request to listen to a favorite music album or just a single song, watch a movie, make a grocery list, set up your Smart Home, ask Alexa almost anything you may ask of Google and the list goes on and on. We greatly underutilize the Echo Show 5, but we have time to look into all that it offers and set it up accordingly. Our immediate concern was enhancing our home security. It seems our world has become a much more dangerous place almost over night. We are very happy with the additional peace of mind the Ring Video Camera Doorbell affords us. We highly recommend it.",
