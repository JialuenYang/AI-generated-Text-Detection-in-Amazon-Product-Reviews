      "title": "Excellent Anti-Glare Screen Protector with a Minor Installation Issue",
      "body": "The JSAUX 2-Pack Steam Deck Screen Protector offers an exceptional viewing experience with its anti-glare properties and easy-to-clean surface. The actual screen appearance is fantastic, free from annoying glare and minimal fingerprints. However, I encountered a slight problem with the plastic guiding frame during installation, leading to a less-than-perfect fit in one corner. Despite this, I still highly recommend this screen protector for its anti-glare functionality, with a word of caution regarding the guiding frame.\n\nFirst and foremost, the screen protector itself is of excellent quality. It effectively reduces glare, allowing for a clear and vibrant display. I was impressed with how it minimized reflections and provided a more comfortable viewing experience. Additionally, the surface is easy to clean, and fingerprints are minimal, maintaining the screen's pristine appearance.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with the plastic guiding frame was not entirely seamless. While it successfully positioned the screen protector in the correct spot, I found that it was a bit too tight near the top left corner, preventing the protector from setting correctly. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue on my second attempt, ensuring a bubble-free and dust-free installation. However, this slight inconvenience with the guiding frame did lead me to deduct one star from my rating.\n\nDespite the minor installation hiccup, I still highly recommend this screen protector, particularly for those seeking an anti-glare solution. The reduction in glare significantly enhances the viewing experience, making it ideal for gaming or multimedia consumption. Just be cautious of the guiding frame and ensure a proper fit during installation.\n\nOverall, the JSAUX 2-Pack Steam Deck Screen Protector delivers on its promise of anti-glare functionality and easy maintenance. With its impressive visual clarity and minimal fingerprints, it offers a valuable addition to your Steam Deck. Just take extra care when using the guiding frame to ensure a precise fit and optimal installation.\n\nEnjoy the benefits of an anti-glare screen protector and protect your Steam Deck's display while enjoying a superior viewing experience.",
