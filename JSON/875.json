			"body": "I have wanted a sunrise/sunset simulation alarm for years but could never justify it while I was a college student. Now that I have been out of school for a few years and settled into my career I finally took the plunge and I am so happy that I did. This is one of the most valuable purchases I have made in my adult life.\n\nGetting up in the morning has never really been difficult for me. I am an early bird for sure. I haven't slept in past 9 in probably 5 years. In the summer I usually bound out of bed as the sun rises. In the winter? Not so much. It is dark and cold and even the most gentle alarm from my phone would jarr me awake. I have had this alarm for about 2 weeks now and it is the dead of winter and I have woken up feeling refreshed every morning, which translates to more energy and focus throughout my day.\n\nI really like the design. It is simple and minimal - something I am slowly transitioning more of my life towards. It was also really easy to set up. Those reviews saying it was too hard and giving it a bad review obviously didn't read the instructions. I skimmed through the manual and had it figured out in about 10 minutes.\n\nThe front display has adjustable brightness which is a huge plus. There are 3 settings: bright, middle, and off. I keep mine in the middle. I appreciate that the display is an orange color - not blue or white. Less pain to the eyes if you have to check it in the middle of the night.\n\nYou can set 2 different sunrise alarms which is helpful since I wake up later 2 days off my week and like that I don't have to reprogram it for those mornings, I just hit the button for which alarm I need. The sunrise alarm can be adjusted in a variety of ways:\n- time (duh)\n- alarm sound (I like the bird song but there are a handful of other choices)\n- brightness level: it always starts from off then you can adjust how bright it gets by the time the alarm actually starts at you programmed time.\n- how far before your alarm it begins to brighten\n\nI have my \"sunrise\" programmed to start 15 minutes before my alarm is set to start. It goes from off to a deep red/orange to yellow and finally to white. The maximum brightness will absolutely light up a whole room. That is a bit much for me so I have it turned back just a little. I am typically awake sometime around yellow. This wakes me up so much more gently and I have a few minutes in bed before the \"alarm\" of birdsong actually gets me up. So I am awake before my alarm most days and getting out of bed right after my alarm goes off. No more poking at my phone for 10 minutes trying to get myself out of bed in the morning.\n\nThe \"sunset\" can also be programmed, however there is only one setting, not 2 as with the morning alarms. It can be adjusted to your liking in the following ways:\n- how long the \"sunset\" lasts\n- starting brightness\n- sounds played (less options here than the sunrise but more relaxing, I like the rain the most)\n\nFrom the starting brightness that you program over the designated amount of time it slowly dims from white to yellow to orange to red and finally off. I have mine set for 20 minutes and I typically read a paper book as the blue light from screens is counter-productive. Once I stop being able to easily read that is usually about when my body is drifting towards sleep. It finished darkening while I snuggle fully into bed and off I go to dreamland.\n\nIt does have the ability to change the color of the light but the default works just fine for me.\n\nI absolutely love this product. I do have 2 small qualms but nothing to take away from a 5 star review. I notice it more in during the \"sunset\" but the transition from light to dark is not very smooth, I definitely notice it click down with each level. It may be due to my settings and I will see if having a longer period of time to transition from light to dark with smooth that out. My other issue is in the mornings. Once my alarm goes off and it is at full brightness I wish there was a way to turn off the alarm sound but keep the light on. There is a \"snooze\" button but I haven't tried it yet so I may experiment with that.\n\nIn the short time I have had this product I can honestly say it has changed my morning routine and also the effects on the rest of my day. My sleep is more restful and waking up is so easy. It has really helped my mental health and I literally cannot stop raving about it to friends and family. If you are considering purchasing a product like this I highly recommend starting here. There are more much more expensive models but this one is accessible and user friendly.",

			"body": "I purchased this based on all the reviews despite some of them talking about the clock not working after a few months. It comes with a lifetime warranty which plenty of other users have indicated they had no problem with customer service replacing if there's an issue. I reached out to customer service around 10pm to get my warranty registered and they responded in 9 hours (overnight).\n\nThere are so many customizable options which I found fun and useful (though other users found that as a negative - too many choices). Yes, it has lots of buttons that have to be pushed to scroll through the various options. But again, the whole point is that it is super customizable to your wants. I used it to wake up this morning and set it for a 30 minute \"sunrise\" with birds chirping. It worked perfectly and I was already starting to wake up early in the sunrise process but was also able to tell how much longer I had to sleep in based on the brightness of clock. By the time full brightness was reached, I felt like I had been slowly waking up, I was not groggy, and I felt ready to take on the day!\n\nI prefer to sleep in total darkness, so I liked that this clock has a feature to turn off the display very easily. You can also dim it, but I like that you can shut it off automatically and then when your alarm goes off it automatically turns on to medium brightness by default.\n\nThe lights can be dimmed, and the brightest setting is VERY BRIGHT! You can set the brightness setting to any level you desire for it to crank up to for the end of sunrise.\n\nIt has some night time features as well where you can have it set for anywhere from 10 minutes up to 8 hours for a light pattern and/or sound to be going off and then slowly become dimmer or softer until it shuts off at your desired time.\n\nThere's a button on the very top of the clock that you can use to turn it into a night light without messing up any other settings in case you needed to use it to get up in the middle of the night.\n\nThere are two alarm settings each one customizable. And each alarm setting has the option to make it go off on weekdays only, weekends only, or everyday.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with my purchase - and have already convinced a friend and a cousin to purchase one as well!",

			"title": "I finally found an alarm that successfully wakes me up!",
			"body": "I LOVE this sunrise alarm clock! I was comparing this one to others that are more expensive, bought and then originally returned this one thinking I’d like the Swarmir Smart Light Noise Machine that has a phone app and more color features. I immediately regretted returning this one after trying out the sleep-aid and wake-up alarm functions on the Swarmir. While the other color options for ambience and the phone app are awesome, there are several things I like WAY more about the Jall and bought this one again!\n\nPROS / What the Jall Wake-Up Light alarm does better:\n- I find the manual buttons are easier to use on this one vs. the Swarmir (though the phone app for Swarmir is also easy to use).\n- I LOVE the wake-up alarm sound options much more. The wind chimes sound is my favorite and none of the others that I looked at had it.\n- The sleep aid for the Jall clock ACTUALLY helps me fall asleep with the sound and light gradually decreasing until they softly go off. The Swarmir does decrease sound volume and light brightness too but suddenly cuts both off when the timer ends, which is jarring and wakes me right back up again.\n- I surprisingly prefer not having an app to control it, I need this alarm to force me to get up and turn it off. The whole reason I wanted a sunrise alarm was because 1/2 asleep me is too cunning for the iPhone or other phone alarm apps. Phone alarm goes off, 1/2 asleep me taps the phone without getting out of bed, then falls back to sleep within seconds. The ability to turn off the Swarmir alarm with its app causes the same problem—a quick tap on the app while I'm still in bed and it’s off while I pass out again. I set up this Jall clock across the room so 1/2 asleep me has no choice but to get out of bed.\n- Jall has a battery that saves your pre-set alarms, sound choices, and volume settings. The clock cannot run on the battery alone (has to be plugged into an outlet to work) but if you unplug it to move it somewhere else it will turn back on with the correct time and your settings still saved.\n\nCONS / What the Swarmir does better and what the Amazon description for Jall does not make clear:\n- With this one, you cannot use any of the other color settings with the alarm clock, they are purely ambience lighting you can turn-on whenever, but they are separate from the alarm clock. The alarm only uses the orange/yellow/golden light with the alarm to simulate the sunrise (which is still nice).\n- You can set the Jall alarm sound to FM radio BUT you cannot choose any channel you want. The clock will automatically scan for stations that come in clearly enough and will pre-set them itself. You can then choose from those 20 pre-set stations, but if your favorite stations do not come in clearly enough the Jall clock will skip over them. I liked maybe 2 out of the 20 that it pre-set for me.\n- If you're looking for the super colorful, swirling, rainbow fading in and out ambience lighting, this Jall clock is not for you. You can set solid colors or set it to shift through all the colors but they stay solid (fading to one color at a time). This is where the Swarmir one has the Jall beat big time—the color features with the Swarmir are gorgeous.\n- The bottom 1/2 of the Jall clock where the time and LED display show do not light up or show the colors (that part stays dark and shadowy). The Swarmir has a full light-up display so the entire circle is colorful.\n\nTL/DR: While this Jall Wake-Up Light does not have a phone app and does not have all the other color modes for ambience lighting like the Swarmir, I very much prefer the wake-up and sleep sounds, and it’s actually doing its job by waking me up on time in a way that’s pleasant (and doesn’t make me want to throw the alarm out of my 3rd story apartment window 💜). Full disclosure: I did also buy the Swarmir Smart White Noise Machine for the colorful settings and ambience, and I use both every day—Jall to wake-up and fall asleep, and Swarmir for ambience lighting, white noise while I work, and for daily meditation.\n\n**Will update with a video that plays each wake up and fall asleep sound option from this Jall model vs. the other model I also bought for those of you interested.",

			"title": "Best purchase of 2020!",
			"body": "The Jall Wake-up Clock is wonderful! I bought it for myself, to help my body wake up more gradually, rather than be woken up suddenly. Starting my day with a jolt of adrenaline leaves me feeling wiped out for the rest of the day; and, let’s face it. The year 2020 has been a living nightmare. I couldn’t handle the insomnia and chronic fatigue any longer. We live near a police station, and this year there have been more nearby, nightly disturbances than in previous years. Therefore, more blaring sirens at night. It’s made it hard to fall asleep. Also, difficult to wake up, feeling refreshed. So, I bought this alarm clock, because of its sleep function and wake-up light. I desperately wanted to avoid paying for its much more expensive competitor, priced just over $100. This Jall Clock being less than half that cost, I had to give it a go.\n\nI must say, it truly works! The light, so long as it’s not set to one of the colored variants, has such an inviting tone. A yellowish hue that’s reminiscent to a sunrise, but perhaps closer to a flickering candle . . . but without the flickering part. My perception of the color’s tone might have to do with the fact that my bedroom walls are painted a rich, tan color; the light reflecting off that is very relaxing and warm—incredibly easy on the eyes. Which is key, for this sort of alarm clock. Anything too harsh could jar you awake. And the point is to allow your body to wake up gradually. It is fairly bright though, if turned up all the way to level 20. Level 15 is my preference. I set the alarm to begin the light function about 30 minutes before I want my alarm to go off. You can, however, set it anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes prior to when you want the alarm to chime. Often, I’m wide-awake before it ever makes a sound. I absolutely love the Wake-up light function! There are up to eight different alarm sounds to choose from: songbirds, ocean waves & seagulls, splashing creek, typical alarm beep, windchimes, piano & songbirds, slower piano, and FM radio. My two favorites are the songbirds and windchimes. All the recorded sounds are rather nice. They don’t have that cheap, appalling tone to them that some other Sound Machines do. Volume levels go from 1 to 16, with 16 being VERY loud. I set mine to 10, typically. Knowing there are six more clicks I could go up does give me more peace of mind. Say there’s an early appointment I can’t miss. Alarm beep at volume 16 will get me out of bed in a hurry. Most likely, the light function will have woken me up before then, and I’ll turn that sucker off, then leap out of bed, refreshed and ready for the day.\n\nThis clock’s got a nice sleep function too. There are three sounds to choose from: pouring rain, crickets & campfire, and flowing river. You can set it to remain on for 10 to 120 minutes, with up to 20 brightness levels. I personally prefer level 10, for falling asleep. It gradually fades from whatever level you set it at, to 0 after the timer finishes. My husband loved this feature so much, he asked that I buy a second clock for him. And he’s not typically one to do that sort of thing. I can’t recall a time he’s ever said something to the effect of, “Hey, would you buy one of those for me too?” It’s just not like him. That’s how wonderful this clock is. The longer he’s had it, the less he keeps hitting the snooze button, before finally dragging himself out of bed. He has been falling asleep faster, and has gotten higher quality sleep. The same holds true for me.\n\nSo far, this clock has been my best purchase of 2020. After several weeks of using it, my sleeplessness and chronic fatigue have diminished greatly. I am one happy customer. For the price, I highly doubt you’ll find a better Wake-up light clock than what Jall offers. That is why I give this clock a resounding Five Star rating.",

			"title": "It's okay - not a great dawn simulator",
			"body": "I have been using a Phillips light alarm for years but purchased this because the Phillips model doesn't have the option for a light-only alarm (w/o sound).\n\nPros:\n-different light colors (I only used the bright dawn option)\n-different sound options (I only used the silent/no sound option)\n-flexibility with the length of 'dawn' (how long it takes for the light to fully brighten)\n\nCons:\n-size - the lamp is small comparatively, which means even though the light is bright it does not light up the room to simulate dawn - so it's very easy to keep sleeping because it's not enough to wake you up.\n-dimmer option - the dimmest display option is still very bright in a dark room and keeps me awake. The next option is no display at all, which means you don't have any way of knowing what time it is if you wake up during the night\n-the snooze option maxes out at 20 minutes. So because this doesn't light up the room and turns itself off after 20 minutes, it's easy to fall back asleep or keep sleeping.\n\nAfter using both - I definitely prefer the Phillips option specifically due to the brightness of the light & how it lights up the whole room, and how I can keep the light on (vs 20 minute limit).\n\nBiggest benefit with this is the silent alarm option, but because the light isn't bright enough there's not much of a point. I didn't use any of the purple or orange light color or bird/ocean etc noises. Just wanted a simple, bright dawn simulating alarm and this falls short unfortunately.\n\nIf your goal is to minimize light at night/throughout the night and maximizing light in the morning, this won't fully provide what you need. Too much light overnight and too little in the morning.",

The clock does have an alarm with some nice sounds. I wake up in a panic sometimes thinking I way overslept only to realize it was the light and I still have a few minutes to slowly wake up prior to my alarm. I wake up much less groggy for sure. The con is that it is difficult to setup initially in my opinion. This is likely because it provides so many different options, including how bright you want the light, color of the light, scheduling of light vs alarm sounds, sunset options, mood lighting, etc.. I just simply use it for the light in the morning and a very dim clock at night (you can even choose the time to be bright, dim or not show at all). Overall, this has been a game changer for me in the mornings.",

			"title": "Setup was a little tricky, but otherwise solid item",
			"body": "Recently set this up, and so far I'm really liking it! Ability to pick nature sounds, different light intensities for the alarm, and a few options for how far in advance the light gradually starts to light-up before it reaches the selected intensity at the designated alarm time. Option to have light only alarm, sound only, or light and sound at same time. The sound only comes on at designated alarm time. So far I've only been able to figure out one light colour for the alarm itself (wake-up/sunlight) although mood lighting comes in many different colours. There is a quick-on nightlight option by pressing the snooze button at the top middle, which is the only knob button so it's easy to feel and so you're not fumbling around when half-asleep, trying to switch on a light. I like the fact that you can get FM radio as well, since this is the only non-internet device on our house (other than emergency radio) that gets radio, which seems like it might come in handy from time to time. The FM auto-tune works pretty well. No AM radio as far as I can tell.\n\nI will share one thing that messed me up the first time I ever setup an alarm. Moral of the story, TLDR: You may need to setup and run both alarms once initially to get them to start behaving correctly.\n\nHere are the gory details of the setup issue and what I did to fix: Initially, I followed the instructions and setup Alarm 1. It was a Friday, so a weekday. I made sure the day of the week Alarm 1 slider on the back was on the right setting: I set it to every day of the week. Alarm 1 did not go off. I triple checked everything, including the AM/PM setting on both the clock and alarm. Still no dice. At this point, Alarm 2 was off (no 2 indicator on the display) and the Alarm 2 slider was on weekend only. Since it was a Friday evening when I was doing all this seup, effectively for this purpose Alarm 1 was enabled and Alarm 2 was disabled. Well, here's the brain breaking part. After my third or fourth unsuccessful Alarm 1 attempt, I decided to move on and instead setup Alarm 2. I enabled Alarm 2 (confirming on the display) and moving the slider to every day of the week. Once the Alarm 2 time rolled around, Alarm 1 went off! My selected sound for Alarm 1 played, and Alarm 1 flashed on the display. Not Alarm 2; Alarm 1! Worried that this meant perhaps the sliders were flip-flopped, I did a couple more experiments. After this, I was unable to replicate the issue. I reset and enabled Alarm 1, turned off Alarm 2, and this time Alarm 1 worked. I reset and enabled Alarm 2, turned off Alarm 1, and everything with Alarm 2 worked just fine. I know this makes no sense, and as an analytical person it bothers me that it seems to be a weird fluke. Either way, the alarm has worked properly several times since then, so ultimately everything worked out.",

As long as the new alarm comes on everyday as it should, then I give it 4 stars. I’m only deducting 1 star because I wish the volume of the alarm could be louder.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nAt first I loved this alarm clock. The light helped me wake up and I keep it on my dresser so I have to get up to turn it off. My only complaint was that I wish the volume was louder. A few weeks after getting it I overslept and realized I never heard the alarm go off or saw the light come on. I thought maybe I just slept really hard and slept through it (although unlikely). Not long after I decided to start setting an alarm on my phone again for a couple minutes before this alarm was supposed to go off because I found that because I tend to cover my face when sleeping, the light wasn’t always waking me before the alarm. Now that my phone alarm is waking me up I’ve realized that this alarm is not coming on at all some mornings. The light doesn’t come on and the alarm I have set on it doesn’t sound. I’ve changed no settings but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s not a power issue because the clock is still on and shows that the alarm is set.\nAn alarm clock is useless if you can’t rely on it to work.

I've been using it for two weeks and here is my review.\n\nFor the first week of using it I only wanted to use the light to wake me up because noises in the morning bother me. However I wasn't able to wake up just with the light so I added on the sound. I put the bird noises at lowest volume and I wake up perfectly fine. The low level of noise isnt loud at all and the birds are natural sounding.\n\nI love keeping on my light while i get ready and motivated, very calming. The only thing i wish the clock had was a no sound option on the snooze setting. I mean when i snooze the first time and the alarm comes back on, there will always be sound unless you turn it off, which then turns the light off. So I set my \"mood light\" to a sunrise color and turn that on while I get ready.\n\nI haven't tried the fall asleep mode and tried the radio once but unfortunately it could not pick up on any channels near me, but I wasn't planning on using the radio anyways.\n\nOverall, I love the clock and how I actually wakeup peacefully feeling good instead of dreading getting up and constantly snoozing my alarm. The light is especially nice when I have to get up early and its dark outside or during winters daylight savings time and sunrise is later. Not to mention its pretty cheap (compared to the hatch brand) and works as advertised. Definitely recommend if you're trying to wake up more peacefully.",

This awesome clock now lets me wake up at “sunrise” but I get to say when that is! Once I’m up and about and starting my morning routine, it doesn’t matter that it’s still dark outside. And it feels like I’ve added time to my day whether for getting things done OR for just enjoying a day off.\nSo if you need more time in your day, you’ll want to try this alarm clock for a much gentler but effective way to start the day. I prefer the sunrise. But you can wake up to your favorite morning sounds - or both!",

The only issue that I've noticed is if I manually turn the alarm light off while it's in the dim stage, if I actually get up before the bright alarm time, the alarm won't turn on at it's set time the next day even though the symbol is showing that the alarm is still set. I have to press the button to turn the alarm symbol off and then back on again for the alarm to resume working at the set time. Now that I've figured that out I just wait until after the time my alarm is set for to turn the light off.",

			"body": "This review is for the Wake Up Light Sunrise Alarm Clock for Kids, Heavy Sleepers, Bedroom, with Sunrise Simulation, Sleep Aid, Dual Alarms, FM Radio, Snooze, Nightlight, Daylight, 7 Colors, 7 Natural Sounds, Ideal for Gift sold by Jall Store\n\nI needed a reliable clock not tied to my smart phone and it's flaky battery and really wanted to try a sunrise clock but didn't want to spend over $100 to discover I didn't like them. So here I am... Overall, I'm enjoying the concept. The light output is more than enough and the light color range is also nice (soft warm glow to bright white which you can limit when you set the alarm). I initially chose use a 20 minute wake up cycle (light only, full spectrum, no sound), and I've woken a few times just 5-10 min into the cycle (no alarm sound). Absolutely love those days. I've also slept through it because my pillow was over my head... Since, I really can't afford to not wake up on time, I decided to utilize the build in alarm sounds.\n\nGlancing through the list, Ocean caught my eye. I though Ocean would be nice, and at first, it sounded fantastic. Crashing waves, rhythmic - not too fast, and not too slow, not high pitched - just a good ocean wave crashing on beach sound. I though I'd found the perfect match to my sunrise - yes, Zen was in my grasp. Then a few seconds into the track the @#$@ seagulls start squawking. Seriously, why? Have you ever spent time around Seagulls, they're loud, obnoxious and they'll steal anything they can carry. That's not what I want to wake up to in the morning. What's next, soundtracks for a crowded beach, or maybe a sinking supertanker blasting it's horn or a lighthouse fog horn at point blank range so my ears can bleed? You had one job...\n\nUnfortunately, the other offerings followed the same pattern - all seemed just as harsh (too high pitched, disruptive and not in tune with a soft sunrise IMO).\n- birds chirping in the morning - yes, I know birds chirp in the morning. At my house, they're in a tree, over 20 yards away and not trying to be reproduced out of an alarm clock speaker less than a foot from my ears.\n- stream sound (like a steady peaceful river flow sound) - again too high pitched and too fast IMO.\n- windbells - I'm just going to stop you there and note in this case word combo should be wind CHIMES - as in mid-high pitched chimes and not those lovely lower pitched bells that your verbiage implies\n- piano music - Not even once in my life have I wished to wake to a piano (or for that matter drums, trumpets or triangles)\n\nOk, I'm a bit over the top on these alarm sounds, but you get the point. I'm not a fan of this part of the clock. There's a lot of opportunity for improvement.\n\nMy answer was to set alarm 1 with no sound, alarm 2 follows later with sound... If alarm 1 doesn't gently wake me like it should, alarm 2 certainly will, but I'm going to have a rushed morning..\n\nDoes it have an FM radio, yes. Will you want to use it - I seriously doubt it.\n\nPer JALL's reply in the Q/A section of this product when asked about the Radio:\n\nPlease know that when you hold the radio button down, the clock will scan all the available stations automatically and save them as P-01/P-02/P-03 and so on ( up to 10 channels ). You don't need to do anything until it finishes the process.\nAfter finishing, the clock radio will select P-01 channel by default. If you want to change channel, please hold \"+\"/\"-\" to select P-02/P-03 and another channel\n\nJust 10 channels? no way to delete unwanted channels to keep scanning the higher frequencies to reach the channel you want? Where I live, 10 channels doesn't even reach the first decent rock or country station. However, I'm pretty sure this isn't the new digital FM frequency tuners, so 10 might just cover it all in a few more years.\n\nDespite what I feel are failures in the extra features, from a basic standpoint - an alarm clock that simulates sunrise & a 30 min sunset it works, and it works quite well. Yes, better alarm sounds and a functional radio tuner would have been nice, but I'm still happy with my purchase. They also include a bunch of labels/stickers so you can choose to label the clock controls (or not), and you can choose if you want them to be seen when the lamp is glowing or just put them on the opaque body (other side of the inputs). So, for these reasons, I'll give it 4 stars and keep using it until something better comes along.",

The gradual sunrise slowly stirs me out of sleep to the point that I'm pretty much awake by the time the birds start. The birds gradually get louder too, so it's another gentle way to get you going. So much more pleasant than a traditional alarm. I really like this device. It's portable enough to travel with, and your settings are saved after unplugging and plugging back in.",

			"body": "3 CLOCK BRIGHTNESS display levels - INCLUDES OFF!\nHigh is great for daytime, medium is soft and clear for nighttime, and the display brightness level is easy to adjust with a dedicated button for this function on the right side.\n\n20 WAKE-UP LIGHT levels: which are adjustable to your preference both in brightness and 'sunrise' length. Seamless transitions between the different light levels. The light levels are also adjustable by function (alarms & sleep.) The wake-up light turns itself off after 15 minutes, which is convenient, as by then we have the nightstand light on, and a cup of coffee to quietly start our morning.\n\nYES you can easily turn the alarm sounds OFF!\nMy husband already has his tablet programmed to wake us up with different original songs every morning, so I was only looking for the graduated light feature. Since I do not use the wake-up sound options, I'll skip reviewing those, except to say that there were one or two that I found pleasant. I did not test the radio feature, our station options here aren't stellar.\n\nALARM ON-OFF feature - there is visible display indicator when the alarm is on. When lowering the clock display brightness at night, it has been easy to remember to turn off the alarm on Friday night! When turning the alarm back on it will display/flash the alarm time so you will know it is correct. (This is not the light's start time, but its wake up time. Start time will be 10, 20, or 30 minutes before your set alarm time, depending on your interval choice.)\n\nPROGRAMMING & BUTTONS - some found this confusing, I did not. A careful look at the diagram in the setup instructions, and then following the directions step by step made the setup easy and successful.\n\n(I agree with other reviewers in this - SAVE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS, you will need them if you decide to change your programming later.) Intuitively - the buttons were reversed from what my English speaking brain expected... that is, buttons I THOUGHT would be on the right are on the left. This really isn't an issue though - any new and unknown apparatus requires getting familiar with its operation. (Think of the way we have to learn to automatically use an instrument console when we buy a different car.)\n\nSunset and different colors - are not options that I have used, but they were bright, colorful and pretty when I was exploring and setting up my Sunrise Alarm Clock.\n\nPersonal notes: I HATE having an alarm slap me awake in the midwinter darkness, which induces a lovely deep REM sleep in me. Even the quiet lovely music we play to wake up in the morning is startling when I'm deeply asleep and the room is dark. Every winter's nightmare mornings. So, this winter I decided to look for a Sunrise Alarm to bring some, albeit artificial, light into my midwinter mornings.\n\nThis unit is a complete success. We've been using it for a few weeks, and while I don't always wake up to the light, which we have on a soft light setting, and a 10 minute 'sunrise' interval, I'm no longer startled awake from a deep sleep in the blackness of the morning. My husband also likes this Sunrise Alarm. It is quite lovely to wake up to a soft light in the room, already floating up towards consciousness. Regarding location of the unit - we've placed it across the room, on a dresser. It is easy to see the clock display from there, and it softly brightens the room from the dresser top as well. (I did NOT want to be startled awake by a light in my face either!)\n\nI twice spent DAYS researching reviews and recommendations both here on Amazon, and in general web searches. This particular Sunrise Alarm Clock was NOT listed in the web recommendations, but it became clear to me that it had the best features/options for what I needed. It was hard to find this particular one in the jumble of similar looking products, but it is worth the search!\n\nI seriously considered several Phillips models, BUT, there were features missing in some of these that were important to me, and a large number of people reported that the expensive units failed around the end of warranty mark. My husband's comments about that (as all electronic items can be glitchy) was that we could buy an awful lot of more economical units for the cost of one Phillips! In the end, Phillips just did not offer the product that I was looking for. JALL did! And I'm happy that this was my first choice!",

			"body": "I live in a room that has no windows, so I have no sunlight come into my room. For the longest time this made waking up for me very difficult, especially during the pandemic when I was forced to work from home and didn't really have a routine. I saw the price point of the alarm clock which was much lower than some other alarm clocks on Amazon that also have the artificial sunlight feature, so I went ahead and bought one.\n\nI was really surprised at how well it works. Set-up was very easy, it only took me about 5 minutes to unbox the alarm clock, set the time, and set two alarms. No other set-up is required unless you're wanting to set up extra features from the get-go, but I only bought the alarm clock for the artificial sunlight. Controls feel a little strange at first, but are easy to learn and get the hang of. I still have the manual but I haven't looked at it after I first set my alarm clock up.\n\nThe artificial sunlight works great and the light it produces looks very natural. It's also nice that you can set the sunlight to start anywhere between 10 - 60 minutes before the alarm goes off. The light will start at a dim red and will gradually become brighter as the alarm gets closer to going off. I have my first sunlight set to start 60 minutes before the alarm goes off and I find myself waking up a few minutes before my alarm goes off everyday. The artificial sunlight really helps, and on most mornings I feel well-rested when my alarm goes off instead of confused and groggy.\n\nThe alarm clock has some extra features built into it, such as a radio player, different colors of light you can make it shine (other than yellow for sunlight) for mood-setting in your room if you wish, and a sleep mode. I haven't really dabbled in the other features besides the sleep mode, so that's the only extra feature I will review. Sleep mode is something you can set up on a given night, and it allows you to set up a light that starts off bright but then gradually gets dimmer (basically the opposite of the artificial sunlight for the alarm), as well as play a loop of a sound for a given amount of time, and the sound can play for up to two hours (though you can of course set the amount of time that the sound plays for). There's only three sound settings available for the sleep mode to play: Rain drops, river, and campfire (which plays fire and cricket noises). You can also set the radio to play for sleep mode if you wish. I've found the sleep mode helpful on occasion, and it's a great extra feature. The only downside is that there's only three different types of sounds to play for sleep mode. More variety would be nice, but for an extra feature built into the alarm I can't really complain. Sleep mode also does not re-occur every day like alarms, it's something that you have to set up manually for each night you want to use it. This is actually something that I like because I don't use sleep mode every night, only on occasion.\n\nTwo quick things I want to mention is that while the alarm does not connect to the internet, it does have built-in memory, so if you unplug the alarm the time on the clock and any alarms you set up will be saved once it's plugged back in. The brightness features for both the alarms and sleep mode are also optional, as well as any sounds associated with them. So for instance, if you just want to be waken up by the artificial sunlight but don't want to have an alarm sound to go with it, then you can set an alarm up to not play sounds. And for sleep mode, if you don't want a dimming light to be on your alarm clock, then you can turn that light off and just let soothing sounds play.\n\nOverall, this alarm is great for the value and quality, and I'm happy with my purchase. It also comes packed with features that I didn't even consider or care about prior.\n\nPros: Great price, great natural artificial sunlight, great extra features like mood-setting lights and sleep mode, semi-large plug-in cable, easy-to-use buttons and set-up, charging port in the back of the alarm to charge devices like phones (this is very useful if your night stand doesn't have a charging port close enough by), a lot of customization options for alarms, sleek design, built-in memory, optionally allows batteries to be put into the bottom of the alarm so that it will continue to work during a power outage.\n\nCons: No internet connectivity, meh sound quality, not a lot of sound loop options for alarms or especially sleep mode.",

			"title": "Gentle Wake Up Perfect For Anxiety",
			"body": "So I have really bad anxiety and that makes waking up to an alarm clock an issue. I'm not sure how it works but if my alarm clock noise or how it wakes me up is too jarring sometimes I'll end up hyperventilating and freaking out when the sound of it jars me out of my sleep. Even when I'm not tired I'll stop or snooze the alarm when it goes off on reflex just because I want the noise to stop so, as you can imagine, there isn't much success with me and regular alarms. I tried this in the hope that the light would make it a little harder to ignore but I didn't expect it to change my entire wake up routine.\n\nSo for my alarm I have it set to start brightening up 10 minutes before it's time for me to get up and my alarm noise is water and seagulls so that way it's something calming yet loud enough to warrant a reaction from me. Much to my surprise it's the light that wakes me up more often than not usually the brightness of the alarm waking me up maybe 2 or so minutes before the alarm goes off which gives me time to kind of settle into being awake and shuffle across the room to get my alarm. The gentle wake up I've had has changed my mood so much in the mornings and definitely changed the pace of my day in a way I hadn't expected.\n\nIf you're like me and quick with a snooze or stop alarm and just generally hate being scared awake I'd say give this a try and you won't regret it. It's only been 3 uses so far and this clock has proven to be one of my best purchases ever.",

I use my phone to wake up to music, play meditation songs, ASMR, etc to go to sleep and to wake up. I don’t need or want the barely customizable plasticy sounds of an alarm clock whastsoever. I absolutely do not want to listen to a radio like it’s 1995 with ads, sports, news, and talking heads. I want to be able to use my curated Apple Music alarm clock playlist even if that’s just playing through my phone separately.\n\nPROS:\nthe sunrise brightness settings go from a rich orange to yellow to white as it gets brighter. The lowest settings are dim enough and the highest settings are bright enough so you can completely customize your sunrise and sunsets final brightness and has a custom timer.\n\nCONS:\nIt is literally not possible to turn the radio or sounds off on the alarm features. The instructions say if you don’t want sound then turn the volume to one, but even “one” is quite high when going to bed in an otherwise silent room.\n\nYou have to manually set the alarm every day. Your previous settings are saved but you still have to go through the steps of confirming each one.\n\nEXPERIENCE:\nThe first day I did a 20-min sunrise to medium brightness, set to the actual time I wanted to wake up, but when you hit snooze (the easiest button to find) it turns off both the light and the mandatory music (I chose bird sounds as they were least annoying).\n\nBut the problem with turning the light off to snooze is you are defeating the entire purpose of having a sunlight alarm???? If it goes back to pitch black I’m gonna fall back into a deep sleep.\n\nFirst of all, I don’t want to have to use this clock’s music at all, but now that I’m forced to, if I want to snooze the music I lose out on the only reason I bought it: to have soft light on in the morning to keep me from falling back asleep.\n\nThe workaround: You can hit the alarm button to turn it off, then manually turn the light back on. But you will need separate alarms on your phone or elsewhere if you’re not ready to get up yet for the day.\n\nThe second day I tried doing 40 mins to maximum brightness instead of 20 to medium, and I set it to 15 mins after when I need to start waking up, figuring it should be on medium by then and help get me up on time then I can lay in bed for a bit before having to get up to turn it off and then back on again.\n\nThere might be some trial and error in terms of how long the sunrise should be and how bright to work best for you. I face the light away from me so that on max brightness I’m not getting blasted in the face, and rather my faux silk dark curtains get illuminated and reflect the nice warm glow.\n\nI was really excited about the sunset mode, something I’d never considered using, but would solve my problem of trying to get ready for bed in dim lights and slowly wind down, having a chance to go to bed with some light on without having to get up to turn it off later. Perfect idea…\n\nBut AGAIN it’s ruined because I have to listen to obnoxious crickets (only one I could stand) that are still fairly loud instead of, idk, silence??? Or my own actual music???\n\nI won’t use the alarm this way but I believe the same problem exists for those that want alarm sounds but no light, it’s not possible to turn the light all the way off in the alarm mode either.\n\nSUGGESTIONS TO SELLER\nHave an option for level 0 with sound off for any setting\nHave an option for level 0 brightness\nLeave sunrise on when hitting snooze. If I didn’t have music playing I wouldn’t have to hit snooze at all which would be preferred.\n\nBest case scenario would Be that this has Bluetooth that could connect to a phone.\n\nTL;DR\nIt’s good a light alarm, it’s cheap and very lightweight but still looks nice.\nInability to turn sound all the way off is frustrating.",

			"body": "So this was the first sunrise alarm clock that I tested and then I bought a higher priced competitor to see if there were any features that I was missing out on, I wasn't. It's hard for me to notice a difference in my wake up, but I think it's doing something. I don't use the alarm 7 days a week which if I did I'd probably be able to notice a larger difference but with 5 days, it's semi noticeable. I have had plenty of instances where I don't wake up to the sunrise instead I wake up to the alarm, because either I'm turned away from it or it just didn't wake me up that day. The features on this one are good, you can adjust the sunrise from 10 minutes and up, which is nice as some others have the minimum set at 30 minutes. I haven't had any issues with the button placements, once you get used to where they are it's easy to find them. One feature I was and am still somewhat annoyed by is the clock placement. When the sunrise is on, the clock isn't visible, which I was annoyed by this at first cause then I can't see what time it is, but then I think it made me wake up more to turn off the alarm cause whatever time it was, was time to wake up. It's a well featured product, the rotating knob at the top is a nice knob lol. Plenty of features with this one and especially for the price it's good. I'd recommend somewhat actually try this one out for a few weeks and see if they notice a difference as mileage may vary",

			"body": "I kept seeing these advertised and wanted one for a year or so, but I only saw them for like $100+!! Last Fall, the first day I woke up to a totally dark room with zero motivation to get up, I checked Amazon and found this one for a much affordable price.\n\nY’all, I LOVE it!!!! You definitely get what you pay for. It’s not fancy. The settings and buttons are slightly complicated to set up and they aren’t a very intelligent set up. If you use it without sound, this is very sensory-sensitive friendly and makes waking up much less overwhelming and less overstimulating. (Neurodivergent person here!)\n\nThe alarm (“sunrise”) starts 10 minutes before your set alarm time and the Snooze function WILL NOT WORK until the actual alarm time. Example, my alarm is set for 6:30. The light starts to come on at 6:20 and if I decide I want to snooze, I can’t utilize the snooze until 6:30 so you have 10 minutes of unwanted light in your face. I did find you can bypass this slightly by turning the alarm off and back on again (a two handed job as the clock is light weight and slides around on my glass nightstand since the button to set the alarm is on the side edge). The light will go off at my set time then.\n\nAlso, if you snooze, the light comes on full brightness at the end of the snooze. It’s pretty intense. 😂😂\n\nI rarely use the snooze option, which I give thanks and credit to this alarm clock for that. I used to be a chronic snoozer and this sunrise alarm has reduced that 95% or more!! I made use it once or twice a month now instead of like 5+ times every morning. 😂😂😂😂\n\nI wake up in a better mood.\n\nI do NOT use the sounds on this thing. Oh my gosh. I used them for like one or two days and about threw the thing across the room. The sounds are an AWFUL pitch and are on a very short loop. If you are sensitive to noises, I would recommend not using them. You’ll wake up in a bad mood. 🤣\n\nThe light alone is perfect (as long as I make sure the alarm clock is facing toward me). There have been a couple times I was rolled over and slept through it, but usually the light is bright enough to wake me up even if I am rolled on my other side.\n\nI would prefer to invest in one of the more expensive clocks some day if they offer more settings and a bit more intelligent set up.\n\nHowever, the quirks with this are pretty minor for the price. I highly recommend.",

			"body": "I really like this alarm clock and I wish I had thought to buy something like this sooner. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and it’s so much nicer to essentially feel like I’m waking up on my own (at the same time every morning, suspiciously), rather than being jolted awake by the sound from my phone. Also, the instructions on getting it set up are crystal clear, I LOVE THAT! I’m the worst at understanding technical directions but I’ve been able to figure this little thing out really easily.\n\nSo, this clock lets you choose the brightness that it will go up to when you set the alarm and also the time range for when it will go from the lowest possible setting up to whatever you set it to. For example, I wake up at 7AM and set it for a 30 min range. So, from 6:30 to 7 it will go from the lowest light to the brightest light. At exactly 7 it will play birds chirping at a low volume per my preferences, and that’s how I wake up everyday. Some days I wake up just a little before 7 and just lay there waiting for the birds to cue me to get out of bed. It’s a nice, gentle wake up.\n\nI do wish that the light was possibly a little brighter but it gets the job done so I can’t really complain. Also, I’ve only tried the sleep mode out once and didn’t care for it, but I think that’s just a personal thing. I’m able to get to sleep relatively quickly and once I’m in bed I like complete darkness so it only annoyed me. Whatever. Speaking of dimming lights, the digital face-time thing can be dimmed! (There is full brightness, dimmed brightness, and off, where you can’t see anything on the screen but it’s still running) I really like this because I used to have to cover other alarm clocks since they were too bright and I prefer near-total darkness to sleep. When the time is dimmed it doesn’t light up your whole bedroom and glancing at the clock in the middle of the night doesn’t bother my eyes or disturb my sleepiness at all.\n\nAnother cool little thing I like is that it keeps the time if you unplug it. I renovated my room this past weekend and had it unplugged for like a full day and when I plugged it back in the time was still accurate. Anytime I unplugged it to move it around, it kept the time just fine. I even dropped it once and it was fine. (Barely scuffed it, thank goodness it’s not glass)\n\nCon: It’s a little more lightweight and plastic-y than I expected when I got it, so if you’re someone who wants your alarm clock to look and feel extra lux in your hands, this may come off as a little cheap-ish seeming when you get it. (that’s how I felt when I first opened it) but it still looks really nice, and most importantly, works really well.\n\nAll in all, I’m hella happy with my purchase and I highly recommend other folks give it a try. You’ll wake up less grumpy and for other not-morning people like myself, it makes morning incrementally less awful.",

			"title": "Finally found the perfect alarm clock!",
			"body": "I bought this because I always have trouble waking up in the morning, especially in the darker months. I have tried a variety of different ways to wake myself up slowly. The one that worked the best before this alarm was playing a radio station of soft music on low volume. However, this alarm clock has definitely beat that. I find myself waking up naturally to the light, and not feeling exhausted, I was woken from a deep sleep, which is how almost every other method makes me feel.\n\nWhen it comes to the specifics of the clock, I don’t really use anything other than the sunlight function. Sometimes I’ll use it as a low light reading lamp at night, but I don’t need the radio or sound feature and won’t be using it. The speaker isn’t super high-quality anyway. I also don’t really need to use it as a clock so I always dim the numbers that show up. My one complaint is that each morning after the sunlight turns on, even if I’ve turned the clock light off (showing the numbers) the night before, the clock light will come on again. So essentially, if you want to use it only as a sunlight lamp, and not a clock, you need to manually dim the clock number lights every day. Not the end of the world, but would really like if there was a way to turn off the clock completely.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this product. It definitely has improved my mornings.",

			"body": "I had been researching sunrise alarms for awhile and found this one! I love the multiple mood and night light colors, as well as all the possible ways to configure the alarms (sounds, volume, light brightness, length of dawn time). I also love that you have several options for the display brightness of the time, including off. The only thing I wish was different was that it had a longer cord but I made it work so it’s not that big of an issue.",

			"body": "This makes waking up in the morning so much easier. I often wake up gracefully very soon after the light comes on. I have it set to come on 20 minutes before my alarm.\n\nI don't wake up nearly as groggy as I used to. That even applies to nights when I don't get nearly enough sleep. I looked around for a good one before purchasing this one, and this one is better than the rest in many ways. Get it if you're thinking about it!\n\nMy only gripe is the annoying noise it makes when you turn off the alarm. It is quite loud, which makes no sense because you've already gotten up and out of bed to turn it off. If you share a room with somebody, this might be an issue for it is far louder than the pleasant sound you hear that gradually wakes you up. I don't get it...\n\nOverall a great device and you should buy it anyways.",

			"title": "A Dreamy Sleep Companion for Kids",
			"body": "We purchased this alarm clock for our 3-year-old daughter, and I'm thrilled to report that it has been a solid five-star addition to her nightly routine. After a year of consistent use, this clock has truly proven its worth in our household.\n\nThe soft glow emitted by the light is absolutely perfect. It strikes that delicate balance between not being too bright to disrupt sleep yet not too dim to provide a comforting ambiance. This gentle glow has become an essential part of our daughter's sleep routine, making her transition to sleep smoother and more relaxed.\n\nOne of the unexpected perks of this clock is its educational value. Our daughter has taken to trying to tell the time on the clock, and the easy-to-read numbers make it an engaging learning tool. It's wonderful to see her curiosity sparked by such a simple yet effective feature.\n\nWhile we don't rely heavily on the sleep or wake sounds, they do add a touch of serenity to the overall experience. They may not be particularly loud, but their calming nature makes them a pleasant addition for winding down or gently waking up.\n\nIn conclusion, this clock has been a dreamy sleep companion for our little one. Its soft glow, educational value, and soothing sounds have all contributed to a peaceful bedtime routine. If you're a parent looking for a thoughtful addition to your child's sleep environment, this clock is a fantastic choice. It's been a consistent five-star performer in our home, and we highly recommend it to others seeking a tranquil and educational sleep solution for their kids.",

			"title": "Amazing company",
			"body": "This products is great! it does what a sunrise alarm clock needs to do, and I think it is much more reasonably priced than some other alarm clocks on the market. I really only use the sunrise alarm feature, not the color or the radios, but I do like the sunset feature which I think does help me sleep. The clock definitely helps with morning grogginess and a more natural wake up, especially during the winter time. But the best part about this product is the customer service of this company. I was having some issues with my clock and reached out to the company for some troubleshooting. They were so helpful and amazing, they have gained a lifelong customer. I highly recommend buying from this company!",

I fully appreciate that it is much easier to snooze the alarm than it is to shut it off, because I am notorious for shutting my alarms all the way off instead of snoozing them BECAUSE I AM STILL ASLEEP WHEN THEY FIRST GO OFF. Seriously, I sleep like the DEAD and with just the light and the pretty little birdy setting this wakes me up every time. 5 STARS",

The clock has so many features and the instruction manual is oddly super easy to understand. I was actually impressed by how well written the instructions were. I used it for the first time last night. The dawn features is GREAT! I can slowly wake up out of deep sleep to the brightness I want then my actual preset alarm and desired brightness goes off with the sound of birds. I chose cricket chirping/camp fire sound for bedtime and it was fabulous. I highly recommend this product. I'm a psychiatric mental healthcare provider and sleep is the #1 medicine....this one has my vote!",

Since getting it, I wake up gradually on my own, without the use of a traditional alarm sound or song. I use the sunrise feature and the colors are realistic. You can adjust how long you want the \"sunrise\" to last, anywhere from 1-60 minutes. You can also create a sunset feel to winddown before going to sleep. And you can use the light as a reading light or soft ambient light at night. The only negative I can see is that the white noise sounds aren't that great. But I already use a white noise machine, so it's not a deal-breaker for me. Overall, I highly recommend this alarm clock!",

The alarm isn’t super loud but let’s be real - I don’t need that anyways (lol). I also appreciate the multiple colorful display screens you can put on, creates a nice ambiance to your room.

Starting in the last two weeks (so two months after putting the clock into use), the sunrise function doesn't start lighting up in advance of the set alarm time. I have it set to start lighting up a half hour before I need to wake up, so it wakes me up gradually. This is the primary reason I got this alarm clock. Three times now it doesn't light up until the alarm time, when it lights all the way to full brightness within a few seconds and starts making the set noise. This is quite annoying, as it entirely defeats the purpose of having the alarm clock.",
