      "body": "First and foremost, the cutting process was an absolute nightmare. These strips proved to be excessively challenging to cut to the desired length, requiring more effort and precision than any reasonable person would expect. The frustration during installation overshadowed any initial excitement about adding a touch of flair to my car's interior.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the promised vibrant colors and luster began to fade surprisingly quickly. Within a short period, the strips lost their initial sheen, leaving my car's interior looking drab and worn. The rapid fading not only diminishes the aesthetic appeal but also raises questions about the overall quality and durability of the product.\n\nFurthermore, the adhesive backing did little to instill confidence. The strips had an annoying tendency to peel off at the edges, requiring constant readjustments and reapplications. This persistent need for maintenance further highlighted the lackluster quality of the product.",
