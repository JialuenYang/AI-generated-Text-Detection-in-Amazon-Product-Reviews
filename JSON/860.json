			"body": "My old Samsung phone essentially stopped charging off its usual usb-c cord(s), so I thought that I'd try a wireless system. I wanted something small and easy and reasonably fast.\n\nThis Samsung unit does all three very well. Its about a 3\" square and 3/4\" tall, and has a usb-c cable to a small transformer. You put a phone on it, face up, and a small red light illuminates to let you know that the phone and charger has connected (some phones beep as well, as my newer Samsung does). Once you know where to took for the light (on the upper left ), its super easy to use. The light turns green when the phone is fully charged.\n\nHow one place a phone on it to connect varies a bit, but generally the middle of the phone should be more or less in the middle of the square. If that does work, shift it up or down a bit until the red light comes on.\n\nIts is not as fast as the description makes it sound, but I keep it at my desk and just set the phone on it while I work. I have never timed it, but in an hour or two it always seems to be fully charted.\n\nI had not realize how much I would enjoy not having to plug in wires every time that I charge the phone. If I had, I would have bought it a long time ago. (It did solve the charging problem with my old phone and works fine on the new one that I decided to purchase a few months later.) Easy Peasey.",

			"body": "I got this because the USB-C port on my S22+ was beginning to wear and not hold a tight connection. The Samsung charging pad is more expensive than some other pads available here, but I liked the concept of a built-in fan and the way that the phone and the pad appear to work together.\n\nI've seen some comments here that the wireless charging is slower than wired. Well, that's just the nature of wireless charging. I've used wireless charging on some previous Samsung phones, so I wasn't surprised.\n\nSome people have complained that the charger cuts out or that it is hard to place the phone to get charging to start. I experienced both problems when I was trying to place the phone so that the camera bump wasn't in contact with the charger. I stopped being concerned about that and just placed the phone squarely on the pad. Charging as been 100% reliable since then.\n\nThe charging process does generate heat, and excessive heat is bad for the battery. I found that my phone has an option for fast wireless charging. When I turned it off, it charged with just a bit of barely detectable warmth. As an added bonus, the fan in the charger base doesn't activate. Of course, there is a trade-off: charging is much slower. The phone charges at the rate of about 22%/hour. That may be unacceptable if it being charged during the day, but is more than sufficient for overnight charging.",

Just place your watch and phone in the designated areas to start the charging process. The watch area does not charge your phone as some people have tried in other reviews. I can't complain as this does exactly what I needed it to do. There are led lights next to each station that will glow red when charging and green when finished. There is a slight humming that comes from the fan but it is not really noticable unless you live in a quiet house. I have this sitting on my desk for work and am glad I don't have to go searching for a wire to plug my phone in. I just set it atop the charging pad and continue about my work day.",

You have to make sure the phone is perfectly centered and the surface is smooth, so the phone will slide in a random direction if you bump it. Overall, not a great \"toss it and forget it\" charger. I decided to pick up something that's more of a stand with wireless charging as that provides a better \"cradled\" experience.\n\nPROS: It provides the advertised 15W wireless charging. You can get the full fast wireless charging out of your Galaxy device from this.\n\nCONS: The top has a smooth surface and your phone is prone to sliding off center and stopping charging if you accidentally bump it.",

			"title": "Charges quickly and includes everything you need, including a wall adapter",
			"body": "I bought this charger for $34, and it's a great value. It comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable and a 25w wall adapter, which is one of the main reasons I decided on this product. The wall adapter alone costs around $20 if you were to buy it on it's own. I also love that this is a duo pad and can charge my Galaxy watch and earbuds. Samsung single charge pads cost the same or sometimes even more than this duo charging pad, which makes this duo pad a great value. Why buy a single charge pad when you can get a duo pad for the same amount of money, or even less?\n\nAnother thing I love about this charger is the charging speed. It charges my phone quickly, even when I'm charging two things at once. I was initially concerned that the charging speed would slow down drastically when charging two items, but I've tested it and found that the charging speed barely slows down at all. When charging just my phone, I get about 11 watts of charging speed, this is through an otterbox defender case as well so that's pretty good. When I put my watch or earbuds on the other pad the charging speed of my phone drops only slightly to around 10 watts.\n\nThe second best feature is how compact it is. This charger takes up very little real estate of my desk and I appreciate that. The design is good, and I love that the charging indicator lights are in a spot where you can see them even when you have your phone charging. I have another Samsung single pad 15w wireless charger and it's annoying because when my phone is on it I can not see the charging indicator light. I will be returning the single charge pad now that I have this duo pad.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great buy. I couldn't go back to charging via cable, wireless is too convenient. I haven't charged with a cable since the Galaxy s4. Every phone I've owned since then has only had the USB-C port used once or twice. Once when transitioning to my new phone I'll use a cable to transfer all my data as it's much faster than doing it wireless, and maybe once or twice I'll charge with a cable if a wireless charging pad isn't available for whatever reason.\n\nDo your phone a favor and go wireless.",

I have:\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic\nSamsung S21 Ultra with Otterbox Symmetry case\nSamsung Buds 2\n\nNot relevant to this review, but I'm quite happy with this combination of devices.\n\nI am using the standard watch band that came with the watch. I have been considering getting the Spigen Rugged Armor Pro, but I know that if I do that, I won't be able to charge the watch on this charger. As things are now, however, I've put away the original charger for the watch. This one is fine. I especially like that if you slide the watch around, the built in magnet helps you find the sweet spot for charging. I'm not unhappy with the charging speed compared to the original charger.\n\nI usually position the earbuds case directly in the horizontal / vertical center of the charger. I do not find it difficult to locate the charging coil, and the speed of charging seems fine to me.\n\nThe most difficult part for me is putting my phone on the left edge of the charger. Since I have it in the Otterbox case, it doesn't charge as quickly as it could, and for whatever reason I sometimes have to fumle around until the charger lights up, telling me I've placed the phone correctly. I should note, however, that it does say \"fast charging\" on the phone when I get the correct spot. It's a little harder than I like to position it perfectly, but I feel this is a quibble. Also, it definitely charges more slowly than via the wire, but this is to be expected.\n\nThe main use case for me, which is to be able to charge these three devices at the same time, on a single dedicated spot on my desk, is served perfectly by this device. I've only had it for a short time (several weeks) as of this writing, but I'm quite happy with my purchase.\n\nUPDATE: Even without a case, my S21 Ultra charges very slowly, and it doesn't even meet its own estimate for when the charging will be complete. I'm still trying to figure out if the problem is my phone, the charger, or the charging brick. But the Buds 2 and the Watch both charge as expected.\n\nUPDATE 2: Several months later. I still like it. I have found that it's a bit finicky finding the sweet spot for the phone on the left side, so I'm now using it in the center position, and because there's a wire coming out the back, it's easier to find the spot. I'm using the left position for the earbuds. I am using the Otterbox Defender, and the phone (S21 Ultra) charges fine there.",

I have an S23, and it will not charge it above 92%. I have to plug it in to get to 100% and it takes a long time to charge it wirelessly. That being said it does the job and will continue using it.

It's a chore trying to find the truth amidst all the false advertising on many of these products claiming Qi and Qi2 certifications and 15W fast charging. I've purchased and returned too many fake ones. The Samsung single pad, along with this Duo pad, deliver the full 15W plus some. I've hit nearly 20W at times. The Duo is fantastic. The built-in fan is a nice bonus. Stay away from the Trio, since it drops to max. 9W delivery, unless you need to charge 3 devices at once. This Duo wireless charger is my go-to most of the time, since the charging is fast enough for my needs, and I find myself bypassing the 45W of the wall adapter. By the way, get the Anker 313 USB-C 45W wall adapter. It is terrific. Trust me. Countless failed tries until finally purchasing the one I can recommend... Just get the Single or the Duo. Done.\n\nUpdate: I'm testing this charger while using my Supcase UB Pro which is a rugged, thick protective case. I'm finding approx. a 5% to 10% drop in charging speeds. Wattage is dropping from approx. 19W to 18W peak. This is excellent. I'm totally satisfied with the performance of this charger.",

I use plastic case with bezel and a steel plate at the bottom for car mounts, and it still connects well. Once the phone accepts charging, the link is pretty stable, and doesn't drop without moving the phone a fair amount.\nCons: This charger is picky about your USB-C power source. It has to support 9V and the correct protocol. If the light just gives double-red or yellow flashes, pick a new source. Only one of the C ports on my Shargeek Storm2 is supported. A small power bank and generic wall charger I had didn't work.\nWith some phones, at some battery level ranges, it makes a distinct whining sound. It's not noticable through headphones, and is quiter than my computer's fans, but it may be annoying at a quiet desk.\n\nOverall, good performance that outweighs its issues.",

All the other \"15W\" qi chargers I've tested, even the actively cooled ones, won't get past 1500mA in Ampere. My understanding that a 15W or 10W or 7.5W qi charger delivers that much wattage to the phone but that doesn't necessarily mean the phone charges at that rate, because running the app and having the screen on and all that uses power.

My samsung buds magnetically connect to one side of the pad as it charges. It has indicators that show a device is charging and when it's fully charged. The only downside is 3rd party earbuds I have only charge on one side of the pad and not the other but it's not a deal breaker.",

The charging lights show which device is charging (red) or charged (green) for each section where a device is placed to charge. This is also great for traveling, easily fits in a bag. Our previous charging station had the vertical stand for the phone which made it awkward when packing it a bag, but these are completely flat and much easier to transport.",

As you know how bad samsung service call department, I decide to buy wireless charger, as lots of people said slow charge otherwise it is good. I paid €70 to fix my 6 month old Samsung phone. Even I am not sure Samsung would pay or fix free since I repaired unauthorized person in Amsterdam when it happened again in September. With headache to talk Samsung service department, Samsung said how about upgrade with pay little bit more for a new phone, that is not right way to a suggestion for less than 1 year old phone. Anyway I can’t charge my phone with cord charge anymore.",
