			"title": "Good cards, just keep in mind warranty replacements can be a chore",
			"body": "This review is for the 256 GB card.\n\nAs sizes have increased and prices have declined, I have increased the size of my memory cards on my phones and tablets, previously using a 64GB and 128GB cards. With that being said, the brand I go with is Sandisk and when this went on sale for less than 30 bucks, I grabbed it. They have been reliable and most importantly have good lifetime warranties, although I will put that with a caveat that they can be a bit of a pain to deal with on getting replacements sent. I get the extreme pros because of the lifetime warranty as San disk has moved away from warrantying all of the SSDâ€™s for life.\n\nFor this particular card, I am using as an SSD for my old venerable I-pod, mainly for storing my 88 gigs of music files. This installed into my SSD card reader for my I-pod with no issues and recognized the full size without a hitch.\n\nThe cardâ€™s transfer rate is fast. I copied the music files quickly with no issues. I can access the files quickly and easily and the card has worked reliably as I expect from Sandisk. Keep in mind that I got mine direct from AMZ. I suggest either that or a known reliable seller, which can make a difference in getting a real one versus not. If you get one that has different fonts or just looks different, I suggest checking with San disk directly to make sure you got what you expected.\n\nThe only reason the rating for these are not 5 stars is because San disk has started lowering their warranties on their products and making it a bit more difficult to get warranty replacements.\n\n4 stars",
