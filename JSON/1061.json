      "body": "I have owned this controller for about five months now and I can say without a doubt I made the proper purchase. It is cheaper than the Microsoft equivalents but works (assuming) just as well. I've logged 70+ hours playing Spelunky on this Bad Boy as well as 60+ with Euro Truck Driver 2 and I didn't have to change a thing in the settings. It worked as soon as the games turned on. And its the same way for every single other game I have played using it (at least 50+, I have a massive Steam library but prefer Keyboard/Mouse for first person games. Rouge Legacy, Dirt 2, Strike Suit Zero, Super Meat Boy, honestly the list could go on for ever but for every single one it was pick up and play using this controller).\n\nI must add that I play first person games with keyboard and mouse so if you are looking for review that covers that in particular you may want to skip mine.\n\nI have encountered one problem that is going to require a bit of maneuvering and fixing to make work properly. Not all older games subscribe to the \"pick up and playness\" that I referenced earlier. Honestly so far it has only been one game (GTA: San Andreas), but I'm confident I can fix the issues at hand. It just gives me pause when it comes to other older games that it wont be so easy to \"pick up and play\".\n\nIt fits nicely in my hands (I have very large hands so it may be different for others) and the buttons seem to have normal responsiveness. The triggers have the right amount of resistance so you can make the perfect shot. Cord length is also long and has never been a hindrance to my gaming experiences.\n\nIt has fallen to the floor a few times off of my desk or out of my sleepy hands but has zero cracks and it has not affected its performance at all. Durability has been great. Triggers still work like they did coming out of the box which is wonderful when you consider a game like Spelunky requires you to hold down the right trigger for speed the entire game.\n\nSo to recap; Every modern game I have played using it has been a seamless experience. It is as if it is a 360 or PS3 controller. The lone older game I have tried to use it with has been a little wonky to say the least but I am confident I can program it to work the way it has with modern games. I should also add works great with NES and SNES ROMS. I cant believe I had been playing ROMS with a keyboard for so long. A controller makes them infinity easier and just feels right, makes the whole experience a bit more nostalgic.\n\nIf you are put off because it isn't an official Microsoft or Sony product stop it. This controller works amazingly with all modern games (again I use keyboard/mouse for first person games so that might make this review completely worthless to you) and with a couple minutes of fooling around can be programed to work perfectly with older games as well.\n\nI do not regret buying this in anyway shape or form. It is a perfect controller for me to dig into my obscene library of games. I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to a friend.",

      "body": "Pros of the Logitech G F310 Wired Gamepad Controller:\n1. Affordable: The G F310 is generally budget-friendly compared to other gaming controllers.\n2. Versatility: It's compatible with both PC and popular gaming consoles.\n3. Familiar Design: The controller has a layout similar to popular console controllers (PS2 Controller clone) making it comfortable for users accustomed to those designs.\n4. Customizable Buttons: You can assign different functions to the buttons using Logitech's software. This is done by putting then controller in “D” direct input mode which is a switch on the back of the controller.\n5. Even though the description does not mention this it does feature vibration feedback. This provides tactile feedback during gameplay, enhancing the gaming experience by adding a sense of immersion through vibrations corresponding to in-game actions.\n\nCons:\n1. Wired Connection: Some users may prefer wireless controllers, and the G F310 is wired.\n2. Build Quality: While decent, it may not feel as premium as more expensive controllers.\n3. Limited Features: It lacks some advanced features found in higher-end controllers, such as advanced haptic feedback or gyroscopic sensors.\n4. D-pad: Some users find the D-pad less precise and cheap feeling compared to other controllers.\n\nOverall: Great controller for the price that is usually compatible with anything you can plug it into right out of the box but is also customizable. Most reassembles the Playstation console controllers look and feel.",

I purchased this one because, it is updated to USB 3 from USB 2, which is nice when you are playing retro games or games you like to play on PC using a controller instead of a keyboard and mouse. On Windows, it is plug and play. Have to make some setting changes in Steam/Game you are using the game pad with.\nThe buttons are firm, not mushy, and are accurate when pressing. The dual sticks are great for top down shooters and are accurate in movement. Again, you have your trigger buttons and L R buttons. Since it is USB, you do not need to have batteries, and the force feedback is also a nice touch but easy to turn off if you do not want that feature on.\nFor 20.00 usd, it is a great buy and I highly recommend it.",

You can tell by how light it is, and when you push buttons - especially the d button. If you are a heavy gamer, I think you would prefer something of a better quality.\n\nHaving said this, the price is incredibly low. I think it would be hard to find a controller this quality for a better price. I needed the controller for one game, and it has definitely served it. This might also be good for younger kids who break things easily - as if they break it, you are out only a small amount compared to most controllers.\n\nThis was a plug and play.

In a relaxed position, the paddles should be right under my thumbs, but in this case, that is where the A, B, X, Y buttons and D pad are. By comparison, my PS4 controller paddles are nearly spot on where they should be in relation to my relaxed thumb position. Not a deal breaker but it could be better.\n\nI'm a Logitech fanboy and generally very, very happy with all of their products, this controller is no exception.",

I had been thinking of going old-school for a while and it was time. This controller does it's job, sacrificing wireless conveniece for fewer unwanted in-game mistakes was worth it in the long run. After all, I shouldn't have to go through the trouble of recalibrating my equipment every few months or weeks just to stay at the top of my game. It's just a shame that Logitech hasn't (or won't ?) upgrade their wireless controller and offer it on their website. Luckily this option was available despite getting it from a third party vendor, I'm a fan of Logitech and didn't cherish the idea of switching brands to get good results and I REALLY don't want to buy yet another console that I don't want just for a reliable wireles game controler. I've got a PC and a Steam account, I don't need to spend upwards of a thousand-plus dollars for a Playstation or an X Box and repurchacing the games I already have on my desktop's hard drive when the price of one controller fits my budget. The only complaint I have (which every gamer has had since the 1980's) is that the chord could be longer, but I don't have to put up with drift anymore, so I'm happy with the results regardless after a few weeks with this controller. Do I recommend this controller? Absolutely ! If you're tired of controller drift and can put up with the chord then go for it, it works well and it won't break the bank. Only thing is, it's lighter than you may be used to, no battery and no vibration feature seriously cuts down on the weight and will feel weird at first until you get used to it.",

      "title": "Great controller, frustrating clamshell",
      "body": "I've been playing console video games for at least 22 years, right around the time I picked up a SNES controller on the family console for the first time in the early 90s. This continued through the late nineties when my parents purchased an N64, to the early 2000s when I purchased a PS2, 2007 when I purchased an Xbox 360, and continues to this day after I purchased an Xbox One a couple years back.\n\nWhy mention my extensive console gaming experience? PC gaming is a completely different animal. When you grow up on D-pads and analog sticks operated by a single thumb, trying to fit WASD into your head is a tall order. Here's a good analogy anyone can relate to: let's assume you are awesome at typing on a QWERTY keyboard, 150 WPM or some such. You get a job as a data entry technician, and when you sit down on your first day... they have DVORAK keyboards. What are the chances you're going to learn a completely new keyboard layout to do your job? None. You're gonna go to Wal-Mart on your lunch break and buy yourself a QWERTY.\n\nWhich segues into why I purchased one of these. I needed a gamepad for my PC because I simply could not adjust to the completely different hand placement and movement paradigm that comes with a PC video game. I kept losing my finger positions on the keys and high-stress situations (like attempting to dodge and exchange fire with an enemy on a shooter) were really getting me in trouble because three-finger movement on WASD was taking too long to process.\n\nAdding to the complications are that my system is Linux, which is usually a no-go from the start because nothing ever seems to work on it. I decided to take a chance on this anyways because with Amazon gift cards and a Prime trial, I got it for $11.\n\nTo begin with, the package this controller comes in is a nightmare. It's a clamshell with no room to maneuver a pair of scissors or a razor blade around the controller inside, so you have to use the little tab and perforations on the back. Problem is, the perforations end halfway down where the controller is contained, so your only option is to tug on both ends and send your controller flying when the package inevitably bursts open. After collecting the entire contents of the package from the floor, all that's inside is a controller and two small squares of paper. I seemed to recall the product description mentioning software, so it must be online somewhere I suppose. Either that or I really sent a CD flying and can't find it.\n\nBut the moment of truth comes later, when you plug it into a PC. Does it work? As a Linux user, the answer is, surprisingly, yes.\n\nI plugged in the USB connector and nothing happened. This either means the operating system knows exactly what it is and doesn't have to do anything, or you're SOL and need a driver or something. My eyes were drawn to the little Logitech logo on the center of the controller, and I decided to push on it to see if it was a button like the XBox Guide button on their controllers. It is! Steam's Big Picture mode launched and I needed no configuration or messing around with anything to make it simply work. On a Linux system. I was amazed.\n\nSo I decided to push my luck on a ROM using a program called Mednafen, which is a multi-system retro console emulator. Didn't work so well any more in Xinput or direct mode, though this is almost assuredly due to Mednafen's programming and not anything to do with the Logitech controller. I searched out the profiler software mentioned by the instructions to attempt to fix this problem, but after finding the Logitech support page I discovered that they only offer software to recent versions of Windows, so you won't get any help from them if you run another system. About 5 minutes of Google searching later and I find QJoyPad, and now everything is perfect.\n\nThis controller has a total of 12 buttons (2 bumpers, 2 triggers, click analog sticks, select, start, A, B, X, Y) and 6 axes (Dpad X/Y, left stick X/Y, right stick X/Y). The Logitech logo launches Steam Big Picture for me, but I have no idea if it will work on anything else. It has a very similar size and form factor to a PlayStation DualShock controller with fatter feet on the bottom, which I like because DualShocks are bony and poke my palms uncomfortably. You'll see the form factor is very similar in the attached photos, which I also placed alongside Xbox controllers for contrast and a pack of standard playing cards for scale.",

But if you don't really care about that stuff and just want a well built controller with the standard modern Xbox/PS style layout, this one is a great choice. I have never had a game that supports controller input fail to map the controls correctly or anything like that. And if you install Logitech's profiler software, you can fully rebind the controls yourself - allowing you to correct annoying control setups in games that don't have built-in rebindable controller controls, or if you decide you want to use it for a game that doesn't even have controller support you can rebind the buttons to keyboard buttons so as far as the game is concerned you're just using keyboard controls. Not sure exactly how sophisticated the profiler is in terms of macros and the like because I've never bothered to install it, since this controller just works with no fuss for all the games I've tried it with.\n\nIt even has a toggle switch on the back to switch to directinput if you wanna play some ancient game that lacks xinput support (if you don't know what this means, don't worry about it - xinput has been the standard for years now and any remotely modern game with controller support is gonna use it).\n\nAll the buttons still feel good after 100+ hours of heavy use. I haven't noticed any issues with thumbstick drift, a problem even the \"premium\" controllers sometimes have. The d-pad is much higher quality than on most cheap controllers - it has 4 separate switches for the 4 cardinal directions instead of just one in the middle, so it is more reliable and feels better to use). The controller itself feels a bit lighter than an Xbox controller but still feels sturdy and durable.\n\nI'll admit I'm a big of a Logitech fan, so maybe I was biased to like this controller - but there's a reason it's one of the most common recommendations for a budget PC controller and the top seller in the PC controllers Amazon category. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to an Xbox controller, and don't mind a wired controller or lack of rumble support, this is the product you're looking for. At full MSRP of $24.99 it's a very good deal, and if you're patient and look for deals it's not hard to find in the 15-20 range at which point it's an absolute steal.\n\nIf you want a budget option that is wireless and has rumble support, look into the Logitech F710.",

      "body": "Short version: Good enough for someone who doesn't controller all the time. Bought another to replace a +1 year old one.\n\nMisc background. I main KBM ever since I started playing games on the PC, after I stopped really old games on my Sony Playstation 2 around 2010. No particular reason though just what I had. The controller on the left is from 2016 and as you can see mostly sat on a desk collecting dust after a combined week or two of Super Meat Boy, 20XX (a Megaman style game), and Streets of Rogue 2p local co-op with a friend. Those first two recommend controller, the reason I bought this. Despite how bad it looks it still sorta works.\n\nThat controller on the left really seen use after a year of Genshin Impact. It got real noticeable when the A button started collapsing and wouldn't reset consistently so sometimes I would jump again or select or try crafting something twice. The B button for attack was starting to get loose too. I guess I got lucky because I don't remember getting any stick drift unless that one premium $80 or something controller.\n\nIt was time for a replacement. That is the new one on the right after doing some weapon ascension material domains with it. Some things I didn't notice on the old controller as I was putting days with it, how grippy the plastic is before hours and hours of human sweat smoothed it, how the thumbsticks actually have textures on them, and of course how loose the more commonly used buttons were getting.\n\nIf you're a first time controller buyer this controller should suit most of you fine. I know some more controller heavy clanmates of mine have replaced Playstation and Xbox controllers (though they use them more so it's probably expected) but if you controller sometimes this could do fine. If you controller sometime but want a more premium experience I'm sure the $40 tier ones are good .\n\nA con for the Logitech F310? I guess the triggers are pretty strong especially if you're an hour into Human Fall Flat night. Oh and no vibration. Shame. The $40 tier Logitech wireless controller/gamepad has force feedback but having to compare $40 tier controllers is a bit harder. There are a gorillion sub $30 tier controller manufacturers you can choose to buy from on Amazon, but there's only 1 Logitech.\n\nI bought a USB hub and plugged it in the hub, under my monitor, so the cord length was plenty for me and whenever a friend would come over for some twin stick action.",

Like at least 3-5 times a day. On to a hard faux wood floor. Every single dang day. Because I’m ridiculous and always have too many things in my lap and stand up and forget or I’ll get caught on the cord or I’ll set the controller down and gravity takes hold and it falls off the desk.

Since my purchase, it has seen much use, but it continues to work while other, more expensive options (looking at you, Nintendo) would have broken down with just regular use. I *may* have dropped it a couple of times...ok a bit more than a couple but it took it like a champ.\nOnly gripe with it that causes me to give it a 4 star review is that the driver that comes with it hasn't been updated since 2010, and prevents Windows 11 from engaging the Memory Integrity function.\nAll in all, pretty satisfied with my purchase.",

I thought a big brand like Logitech would do a little better than this.\n\nFor starters, every single element (excluding the D-pad) has its own unique amount of resistance. This is especially true of the bottom triggers AND the joysticks. The left stick is almost limp, while the right stick is so stiff it'll give your thumb a workout. The bottom triggers also have two completely different \"feels.\" It's like each piece was sourced from an entirely different factory. It's just enough chaos to totally confuse your brain.\n\nAnd - can we talk about these absolutely BIZARRE triggers? The top triggers are clicky and shallow. The only thing I can compare them to would be the \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons on my old DSLite. Fine for buttons you're going to press once every half hour, but certainly not for triggers. The bottom triggers, meanwhile, are SO weird. Their axis of rotation is so unnatural - almost like I've got to press them on the far side instead of the face (if that makes sense). There is also nowhere for your fingers to rest or hook on to them. These things are actively finger-hostile. I tried playing an FPS and my hands threw a fit. (Okay, okay... *I* threw a fit.)\n\nAnd the ergonomics! Or rather, the complete lack thereof. This thing just feels awkward - horribly, heinously awkward. The thumb sticks are so tall that I have to stretch my thumbs to get a hold of them. There's nowhere for my fingers to go, especially my index fingers which, as I've said, can't play nice with the triggers.\n\nThis controller is also EXTREMELY lightweight. I know, I know - heft does not equal quality. But I'm not talking about quality here. I'm talking about the fact that it feels like holding a hollow, dead fish. At least put some rocks in it or something.\n\nI know I'm used to AAA console controllers these days, and this thing never claimed to be a DualShock4... but there's some serious quality and design issues going on here. Maybe it works for other people's hands, but it certainly doesn't work for mine. The inconsistency of the joysticks is particularly unforgiveable.\n\nWith all of that said, this is the best D-pad I've ever used. Switches feel nice and non-mushy, and are very consistent.

The D-pad is \"floaty\" and loose (I mean rattling loose), and will actually press up and down at the same time, which should be impossible but the innards are so cheap, it does it anyway! The triggers are very stiff. The other buttons are just stubborn about working during combo presses. Anything that requires timed or multiple buttons, is hit or miss, mostly miss, and will just randomly fail sometimes no matter how careful and deliberately you press them. Absolutely the most frustrating controller I've ever used as far as buttons just not responding 2, 3 times in row.\n\nThis controller \"fails\" after every reboot with a dreaded \"!\" in device manager and an error about \"this device cannot start\". I have to unplug it, reboot, re-plug and let it get re-detected every time for it to work, until the next reboot. I had an F310 YEARS ago that did the same thing! It was the reason I eventually trashed that one. These things are junk! Plain and simple.\n\nIt has a long throw (too tall) analog sticks. Makes your thumbs bash into each other. In my photos, it is compared to the EasySMX ESM-9100 (Xbox style - get this instead), and the ZD-V+ (best D-Pad, very PSX-like) so a little about those if they are on your \"maybe list\".\n\n1. The EasySMX ESM-9100: Very good controller (xinput+dinput), way better than the F310 overall, especially if you prefer the Xbox style. Feels solid and of \"OEM\" quality. It is in the same price range with the F310 but is a superior controller in every way.\n\n2. The ZD-V+: Good, but flawed controller (xinput+dinput). Still better than the F310 not as good as EasySMX. Had it for ~12 years. Buttons are (always were) a little sticky feeling but function fine, and the analog sticks not very precise and have a longer \"throw\" (tall stick) that I don't care for. The \"triggers\" are pressure (not-so)sensitive buttons that function more like on/off buttons than analog triggers. Edit: this one developed coil whine after ~12 years and is now in the trash.\n\nEdit: Another one I have gotten since this was the Beitong BAT 2. That one has the best analog sticks I have ever seen! 0.9% error report in gamepad tester at \"hardwaretester com/gamepad\". A typical good controller scores 10.0-20.0%. Sadly, the D-Pad on it is not so good. Lots of accidental/false diagonal presses, but for games that only use D-Pad for menu stuff, etc., it's very nice!",
