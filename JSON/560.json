      "body": "My daughter has been using Dial Kids 3-in-1 Body Wash for years, and it's been our go-to product for her bath time routine. She loves bubble baths, so finding the right product was important to us. This body wash is gentle and tear-free, making it perfect for her sensitive skin. The lavender scent is calming and pleasant, adding to the relaxing experience. It's also affordable, and Dial is a brand we trust. I love that it can be used on her body, hair, and as a bubble bath, making it versatile and convenient. This is the only product we've used for years, and we highly recommend it to other parents looking for a reliable and kid-friendly body wash.",
