			"body": "This watch has been a total game changer. I bought it when I was postpartum and couldn't keep track of anything! The find my phone feature was a wonderful addition and saved me so much time. It's nice as a working mom to have something that you can set reminders on and be able to be in contact with your family at all times.\nOne feature that I really enjoy is the Google wallet so I don't have to rummage around my bag pay for things, and the fact that the watch automatically locks itself when you take it off your wrist, but stays unlocked when it is on your wrist.\nYou can send messages in multiple ways such as text-to-speech voice recording or typing it out on a little keyboard in your watch. The options help for when you're in a hurry or when you want to be subtle.\nThe Google maps feature is also very nice, especially if you are navigating an unknown place. It will let you know when you need to turn by vibrating and can even display a small map on the watch.\nYou can tap twice on the button for the assistant.\nGoogle also allows you to download games and customize your watch face.\nThe other reviews mentioned poor battery life and I agree Google could definitely approve on their battery life. I have mine on battery saver regularly and it automatically turns to night mode when I plug in my phone for the night which is very convenient and saves battery. But if you have a good charging routine, it is good enough and the features are incredible and outweigh this weakness.\n\n(The original watch band has been replaced with a smaller one in the pictures on this review)",

			"body": "I've had my Google pixle watch for about a week now, and I'll share my first impressions. I'm sixty-three years old and this technology is something I've been waiting for, for over fifty years. I'll come back in a month and share my experience with it then.\n\nIt looks fantastic, sleek and thin. It's a beautiful expression of technology and styling.\n\nIt does everything I need it to do, and it does it well. I'm running the cardio monitor to detect a-fib, so the battery life is pretty short. It's a small price to pay for a good cardiac monitor. If I have to charge it every day, it's all good.\n\nI love the screen, and the fact that I can read and respond to text messages and email by voice,very cool.\n\nThe only complaint I could possibly have, is the battery life, it's very short. I probably need to turn off some of apps I have running. Other than that, I'm loving the new watch. It is very cool!\n\nEDIT : after the watch did all the updates, the battery life improved dramatically. I easily get two days of use per charge. It charges very quickly (in about an hour) and I am very pleased with my decision to purchase a Google pixle watch!",

			"title": "Best Wear OS for true Android users, but not perfect",
			"body": "I will avoid the facts that this watch is outdated at launch by its hardware (processor). That, coupled with retail and even discounted price also are out of step with the competition. These two big gripes aside. The watch is good and likely the best choice going into 2023 for pure Android Wear OS users (not looking at Apple or Tizen overlay users.)\n\nIts not perfect and Pixel users will benefit the most when paired to this watch. Its lost most of the lag recent watches from other Wear OS brands. Has all the sensors the majority of buyers could want based on watch tech right now. It swipes, it plays well with the apps made for it. It gives you the info you ask of it. There are even a few nice 3rd part accessories now to avoid Google Gouging for proprietary bands. And there are few quirks I hope they iron out soon. Mainly, when the phone is in Bedtime Mode. Make the watch do it too, or add that Zen Mode feature to the watch also. It sucks to have animals tripping the security cameras outside dinging on my wrist and killing my sleep score. The snooze/do not disturb button on watch fails too easily and you have turn it on/off manually everytime.\n\nAs many claim, the battery sucks. Sort of. I can go up to 36+ hours on a slow day, and many others can too. It will depend on too many factors to list. But basically your popularity with notifications and thinking you need the screen always on are the biggest battery hurdles. Most can get use to touch to wake. And maybe only having text, phone, front door doorbell and one email be allowed to bother your watch with notifications. Do you really need to know what cousin Billy had at Dairy Queen when he posts the same pic/vid on Facebook, Instagram, Tic Toc and YouTube, etc. Find a nice balance of wrist information along with what sensors you need checking if you are still alive. You can start the day and track everything till the next morning when you charge it again while you shower and get the next day started. It charges quickly. And most other Wear OS watches have the same daily charge requirements. Nobody on Wear OS is winning on battery. Or Turn every setting all the way up and have a spare charger puck ready for a mid day juice. If you go that route. I suggest a quick release band to ease the removal of the watch.\n\nSo, its not up to the level or price of the Ultra Apple Watch. And if you don't care for Samsung. Your love for stock Android will eventually lead you back to this watch. Unless you forgo ECG sensors. The price will drop soon. Cases are minimizing the fragility of an ALL glass jelly bean design. But when comes to keeping your phone pocketed and yet still have info relayed in a useful way. Pixel Watch is the best current albeit not perfect solution for now.",

			"title": "Look elsewhere unless you love charging",
			"body": "I'll start with the pros because sadly there aren't many. It feels premium and I personally like the small footprint on my wrist as it's not heavy and is comfortable with the band it ships with. Everything else leaves me wondering why I've stuck with Google this long. Battery life is the main reason I returned this watch. If you don't ever touch it, leave the screen dark, disable every feature you can and leave battery saver on constantly, you'll get at most 20 hours of use per day because the thing can't make it a full 24 hours, even when you aren't wearing it at all! I have to charge 2-3 times per day (twice if I do no exercise at all) and it takes around 1.5-2 hours to charge, which seems excessive given my phone can charge from 0-100% in 28 minutes. When you aren't charging, you have to deal with no spo2 sensor (even though it has one), AFib tracking doesn't work constantly and the speakerphone is ENTIRELY UNUSABLE. It crackles when turned up loud enough to almost hear it and when it isn't crackling it's not loud enough to make out voice. You can't even hear the Assistant talk and the alarm wouldn't be noticeable if not for the vibrating. This watch makes me want to spend thousands to switch back and be an Apple customer after years of leaning towards Google for everything. This watch was a swing and a huge miss. This watch doesn't even compete with 5 year old watches out there. Not sure what Google was thinking, but it's making me reconsider being a Google Fanboy as no other Android watch checks all the boxes. My other complaint is the FitBit Premium membership needed to keep most of your data long-term unless you export it elsewhere (which isn't too difficult). Ultimately this experience pushed me to decide to not use a watch for now and I'm going to quit using Google Fit on my phone as I feel I should be getting paid for them to keep and sell my data to others. My other negative is the impact that this has to the environment. While the manufacturing process already did enough damage, this watch needs so much electricity to stay alive that it will cost me more than the watches value to keep it charged, creating more unnecessary environmental impact and costing me more in electricity daily. I can't even believe that I came to these conclusions because I'm a techie/nerd and usually need all the latest/greatest products.\n\nWould not recommend this subpar watch, most likely will convert me from Googles [clearly] subpar Ecosystem. Even Fitbit Sense (which Google owns) gets at least 6x battery life and has more features, but Google made lots of promises for that watch that they still have yet to deliver - so I'm going without a watch now. Very sad this is what they released as their first watch. Maybe they should have waited yet another year if this is all they could do? Everyone I know that got a Pixel watch returned them and everyone I knew that wanted one no longer does. Pretty sad, but you sure aren't getting what you're paying for here. Google needs to remember who their customers are...",

			"title": "My first experience with a smart watch/fitness tracker...",
			"body": "I am writing this as a novice smart watch wearer who was looking for something to wear during runs to replace my very OLD Garmin watch and no-longer-supported Shuffle. I tried running and walking with my phone and with different other devices to replace them after they were no longer viable running companions, but I decided to cave when I found a reasonable price on a \"used like new\" Pixel watch option.\n\nFirst off, buying used was great for me. The quality really was \"like new,\" and everything was in the box. It was also more comfortable to know that I didn't pay full price as I entered into the somewhat confusing territory of setup -- during which the watch didn't want to connect to my phone and then didn't want to download updates. (See the other reviewer here who describes getting the phone to connect to the watch, and I honestly couldn't get the first two updates to download until I had LTE connected and turned off bluetooth and wi-fi.) There's still much room for improvement in the phone and watch management interfaces, but I don't have anything to compare it to other than my continual wonder, \"Why didn't they do it [this way]???\"\n\nThe battery is good as long as you don't actually use it for anything other than being a watch and lightweight fitness tracker. An hour-long run or walk using GPS with Fitbit or Strava AND listening to anything that isn't downloaded (a whole different discussion) easily zaps 50-60% (or more) of battery -- which isn't a big deal if you can figure out a reasonable charging schedule. That said, using the Google charger that came with it, mine normally charges from 9% to 100% in around an hour.\n\nAs for the other features, I am surprised by how much I appreciate the fitness tracking. I didn't think I would care anything about my heart rate or how many steps in a day, but I tend to sit at my computer for periods that are entirely too long and like the reminder that hours have passed since getting up to move. I also like being able to look at my watch to see who is calling or to receive texts, especially when I'm finally *not* at my desk and don't want to have to carry my phone with me when I'm expecting a call or text. Disconnecting is also somewhat easy, since you can manage what notifications the watch receives from the phone app. (Though I do seem to have to reset these with ever phone-app update.)",

Completely caught me by surprise. Works well if I get out bed in the middle of the night, or when I'm trying to unlock the car or house, and can't find the keyhole. The watch is moderately comfortable, and I sometimes forget I have it on. I like that I can receive and respond to texts and calls. I have been away from my phone and answered it on my wrist. The speaker is not loud, but it gets the job done. I like to keep an eye on my heart rate, and I feel like it's fairly spot on when I check it against another device.
