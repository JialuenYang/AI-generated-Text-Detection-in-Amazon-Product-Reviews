      "body": "I'm delighted with the Eucerin Intensive Repair Body Lotion! It's been a game-changer for my very dry skin, providing deep, long-lasting moisturization. The scent is lovely, and it's gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I can apply it in the morning and feel hydrated all day without it wearing off. The consistency is just right - it goes on smoothly without feeling too heavy or too thin. Overall, this lotion is perfect for me and I recommend for anyone with dry or sensitive skin.",
