			"title": "A bit less bass than Moondrop Starfields, overall a great value!",
			"body": "These were replacement for some budget AKG over ear headphones and the persons first IEM's, they certainly obliterate those. For under 20 dollars they're night and day compared to skull candy garbage you would find in most local stores for a similar price. Fairly comfortable and clear sounding, almost as good as my Moondrop Starfield's are, like 80-90% of the sound quality, maybe a bit less comfortable? Probably fixable with some after market ear tips from china for $5. There's less pronounced bass, more so at the lowest tones. Things are a bit less \"detailed?\" overall than my Starfields, hard to put my finger on it exactly, but I still enjoyed listening to them. Cable's fairly short at around 3-3.5 feet long, but you can buy an extension cable for like $5 with the money saved. Includes 3-4 sets of different color of tips for them, may be slightly to big for small ear drums, worked fine for me though. The cable's good, it fits snugly in the IEM's and wraps around the ears fairly nicely. The cable and the IEM's are pretty good looking on top of that. Definitely a fantastic value proposition. If you need something for kids, teenagers, tight budgets or people without the best hearing this is a good option. If you're an audiophile you probably will want something better. Are my Starfields better? Yes. Are they 5x as good? No. Really comes down to how much money you have and how picky you are about your listening experience.",

			"title": "Good value if you can overcome the quirks",
			"body": "Not bad. Mids will sound just a little thin and recessed. High end will be a little sharp. Nice detail and neutrality for the money if you're into that, though. You might ge able to fix some of these short comings with EQ but I haven't had any luck so far. The bass can be boosted nicely, however, and reducing preamp will add some volume granularity despite being almost too easy to drive.\n\nComfort might be hit or miss due to the odd shell shape and so-so tips. If it fits in your ear, it will sit nicely, but otherwise, you'll hate it. The fit is shallower than other IEMs I've used, so that might feel strange, too.\n\nCable feels nice for the price, apart from a small and slippery plug. Mic is nothing special but completely serviceable.\n\nChin adjuster is a little too loose and the stress relievers on the 2-pin ends could be less stiff. The tips deform a tad strangely and should come in more sizes and bore widths, though there is a nice variety in taper. The color-coding for them is also appreciated.\n\nI suspect the Tanzu Wan'er is more flexible but this isn't a bad choice if you were put off by the extreme warmth of the Truthear Hola like me. Don't buy this if you're a basshead or need perfect timbre and textures; do get this if you enjoy a lot of clean-sounding or reverb-laden music. Everything else is kinda a toss up and is worth considering alternatives for if you want to make your money count. Regardless, it should still work for a wide pool of genres if its idiosyncrasies aren't a problem.",

			"title": "Top Tier Twenty Dollar IEM",
			"body": "The 7Hz Salnotes Zero directly competes with the similarly priced Moondrop Chu.\n\nOverall, the Zero and the Chu are neck-and-neck in terms of sound quality. They each have certain strengths and weaknesses compared to the other, but both put other options at the price point to shame. The two IEMs also make different trade-offs in terms of build and accessories. While buyers will need to weigh which characteristics they value more in choosing between the two, both are solid buys for $20.\n\nSOURCES:\nI have used the 7Hz Salnotes Zero with the following sources:\n\nQudelix 5K\nHidizs S9\nE1DA 9038D\n\nPACKAGING AND ACCESSORIES:\nThe 7Hz Salnotes Zero comes in a small white cardboard box. The packaging features pictures of the Zero on the front and back covers.\n\nIn addition to the IEMs and detachable 2-pin cable, the Zero includes six pairs of silicone eartips in several varieties. These appear to be the same varieties described in my Dioko review:\n\nThe red, blue, and orange pairs are squatter and more conical in shape and feature wider nozzles. The light blue and yellow eartips are more round with narrower nozzles. The pink pair is also round but with wider nozzles than the other round eartips.\n\nThe pair of eartips resembling AZLA SednaEarfit Crystal eartips included with the Dioko is not included with the Zero. The Zero includes a product information card and a user manual written in English and Chinese, as well as a small velcro tie. The Zero does not include a carry pouch or case.\n\nBUILD QUALITY AND DESIGN:\nThe 7Hz Salnotes Zero has a two-part plastic chassis with a stainless steel faceplate. The faceplates have a jagged, angular outline. “SAL♪NOTES ZERO” is laser-etched at the base of each faceplate. There is a small circular rivet at the top of each faceplate. The faceplates have developed minor scratches over the course of my review.\n\nThere is a small circular recession on the inside of each chassis with an embossed “L” or “R” indicator. There is also a pinprick vent at the base of the nozzle. The nozzles have the same metal and paper nozzle covers as the Dioko, and have extruded lips to secure eartips.\n\nThe 2-pin connectors are very snug and quite difficult to remove. The 2-pin connectors fit flush with the surface of the IEM housing body. Each 2-pin entry site is marked with a small red dot to indicate polarity.\n\nThe included 2-pin cable has two strands that are joined in parallel below the Y-split. The cable uses a mix of metal and dark plastic hardware. The cable jack has a straight form factor. “SAL♪NOTES” is printed in white along the length of the jack housing. There is strain relief above the jack housing but none at the Y-split. The cable has pre-formed earguides without memory wire and a rubber chin-adjustment choker. The curved 2-pin housings have faintly raised “L” and “R” markings. The cable is mildly microphonic.\n\nCOMFORT, FIT, AND ISOLATION:\nThe 7Hz Salnotes Zero is intended to be worn cable-up. The earpieces have a shallow insertion depth. I found the Zero to be very comfortable. However, secureness of fit is below average and the housings required occasional readjustment with most eartips I tried the Zero with. Isolation is fairly poor. There is mild driver flex.\n\nSOUND AND COMPARISON TO THE MOONDROP CHU:\nThe 7Hz Salnotes Zero is tuned very similarly to the Moondrop Chu.\n\nLike the Chu, the Zero has a Harman-ish sound that emphasizes sub-bass over mid-bass, features a robust pinna gain region, and slopes downward from the pinna gain region through the upper treble.\n\nThe biggest tonal difference between the Chu and the Zero is that the Zero’s pinna gain region peaks later than the Chu. The Chu’s pinna gain region is centered around 3 kHz, while the Zero’s peaks later at around 3.5 kHz. This is a subtle difference, but depending on your ear physiology, may impact which of the two IEMs vocals sound more natural with. The Zero has a twinge more measured sub-bass than the Chu, although the difference between my samples is so small that this may be a question of unit variation rather than intended tuning. Subjectively, I feel that percussion actually has a greater impact on the Chu than the Zero. The Chu also has a hair more upper treble extension than the Zero.\n\nThe Zero’s sub-bass shelf is mild in its amplitude, and sub-bass extension is average. Bass articulation and resolution are both very good. The Zero’s bass is well-textured for the price but is lacking in impact. The result is a clean but underwhelming bass tuning. After hearing the Chu and now the Zero, I have come to believe that if an IEM opts for a pure sub-bass shelf, the amplitude of that shelf needs to be greater than what either of these IEMs displays. The bass does not bleed into the lower mids.\n\nThe Zero’s midrange is on the cooler side. Male vocals have grit but are slightly lacking in warmth. The amount of body to male vocals is somewhere in between these two other qualities. Female vocals are slightly more forward than male vocals, though both are very intelligible. Female vocals do sound more natural on the Chu than the Zero. On the Zero, there is a hint of strain and sibilance. On the Chu, female vocals are just slightly more grounded. With that said, the Zero’s midrange clarity is astonishing for an IEM of this price. The level of presence is essentially perfect for heavy rock genres. Timbre is slightly dry but natural sounding overall.\n\nThe Zero has slightly less lower treble energy than the Chu, which I prefer. Like the Chu, the Zero has a noticeable drop-off in the mid-treble which deprives cymbal hits of sparkle. While the Chu has better upper treble extension than the Zero, the Zero has slightly crisper treble transient delivery. The Chu has a larger soundstage and slightly better detail retrieval. Imaging between the two is comparable. The Zero has the best instrument separation I have heard on an IEM at this price.\n\nAMPLIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND SOURCE PAIRING:\nThe 7Hz Salnotes Zero does not need a powerful source to reach a usable listening volume. I did not notice hiss with any of my devices.",

			"title": "Impressive Sound Quality and Comfort, but with Some Limitations",
			"body": "I recently purchased the Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero earphones from Amazon and overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase. These earphones offer a great combination of comfort, sound quality, and durability.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The ear tips provided with these earphones are incredibly soft and comfortable, making them ideal for long listening sessions. Additionally, the sound quality is truly impressive. The audio is clear, well-balanced, and delivers a rich and immersive experience. Whether you're listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero earphones excel in providing a satisfying audio experience.\n\nAnother aspect that deserves praise is the cord. It is noticeably better than many other earphones I have used in the past. It feels sturdy and durable, which gives me confidence that it will last longer than other cords that tend to fray easily.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Firstly, I have noticed occasional crackling sounds while using these earphones. Although it's not a constant issue, it can be slightly frustrating during quieter moments in music or podcasts. Secondly, the cord length is a bit shorter than I would prefer. This might not be an issue for everyone, but if you like to keep your device further away, it could limit your flexibility.\n\nLastly, the frequency range of the Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero is not as extensive as some other earphones on the market. It struggles to hit lower Hz frequencies and the highest frequency it can reach is 15 kHz. However, if you're not particularly concerned about the higher end of the frequency spectrum, this might not be a deal-breaker for you.\n\nIn conclusion, the Linsoul 7Hz Salnotes Zero earphones offer a comfortable fit, impressive sound quality, and a durable cord. While they do have some limitations such as occasional crackling, a shorter cord length, and a limited frequency range, they still provide a great listening experience overall. If you prioritize comfort and audio quality over the highest frequency range, these earphones are definitely worth considering.",

			"title": "This is surprisingly very good sound quality for $20 IEM",
			"body": "For $20 this is a pretty balanced sounding headphone, a good clean amount of bass and a very clear mid range. Not too much sparkle in the treble but honestly for $20 I don't want them to emphasize treble as it could turn harsh real quick.\n\nVocals are clear and not in the background like most cheap IEMs would usually tune (heavy on the bass but muddy, vocals in the back, and treble either stabbing your eardrum or muted), which is quite a surprise for $20 IEMs, heck even some $100 range IEMs didn't do as good.\n\nAs a baseline I used my Campfire Andromeda ($1000 IEM) as comparison, and honestly in terms of clarity I'd say both are about on par (much to my surprise). However where the Zero falls short on would be overall resolution and details of reproduced sounds. Things don't sound as natural on the Zero but instead a bit more flat, vocals while clear aren't quite natural like the Campfire Andromeda, and overall instruments from live recordings has a bit less life and breathe to them.\n\nTo put to simpler terms, the Zero does not reproduce atmosphere and small details very well, however it is pretty much on par in terms of clarity of sound, which for $20 is very much worth it. Keep in mind that comparing a $1000 IEM to a $20 is extremely unfair, so while I say the Zero isn't as good as $1000 IEMs that's really not saying that this is not a good pair of headphone for its price range. In fact it's probably one of the best choices you can make at the moment. I'm still quite shocked how close it got to the Andromeda which is 50x the price of this thing.\n\nComfort-wise I didn't have too much problems with it, I use it mostly for bedside listening so while it does make my ears just a tiny bit sour after sleeping on it for 8 hours other than that it's pretty good. If you have small earholes you might need to change the ear tip to something smaller, I have pretty stretched earholes due to all the IEM listening from past years so I was ok just using the default red tips that came with the IEM.\n\nFor $20 this is a great product, and honestly a really good tuning for its price. I would definitely recommend this if you prefer a more balanced sound signature.",

			"title": "A nice IEM to visit, but I'd never want to live there",
			"body": "I've been into hifi stuff since the 80s. I've largely focused on speakers, because I really don't love wearing phones of any kind for more than 30-60 minutes. But I still have dozens of phones and a handful of favorites (like the the KSC75 or SR850) that I immediately recommend if anyone asks me what headphones I like. We've also got it pretty great now with so many choices in the budget sector, and things like the Zero are literally cheaper than a new LP (don't buy new LPs, by the way - the horrible value proposition of modern pressings is a whole other thing I could talk about for a few hours). So sometimes I do like to play around in this almost-zero-stakes (no pun intended) market segment. But I laugh at how seriously people are taking this stuff nowadays.\n\nThe Zeros are interesting, and I've spent a good ten hours this week listening to them with a huge variety of source material and trying to like them. I know everyone wants to call these \"neutral bright.\" I agree that they are neutral, but while they *are* brighter than the average $20-40 IEM, I don't know that they are really all that bright. The thing that is peculiar about them is that they really feel like they have purposely limited bass from about 200Hz on down, and then it swings back up around 45-50Hz all of a sudden. That's... *really weird* to listen to, and can be very unsatisfying or hard to adjust to, in a lot of ways, with the majority of source material.\n\nThe best analogy I could make, maybe, as an old-school speaker enthusiast, is a good \"starter\" full-range driver like the Fostex FE208s. Except that the 208s have *no* bass past their early rolloff, a much more ragged and nasty midrange, and they aren't nearly as bright as the Zeros.\n\nThe other important difference, though, is that in a listening room you have the option of supplementing a full-ranger with benefits and strengths everywhere except the lowest 3-4 octaves with a *separate* system (subwoofer, pair of subwoofers, whatever) that can cover those octaves. That, to me, is the main way a small-full-range-based speaker system can be made livable as a primary system. If you stick the Zeros in your ears, you have no such recourse. Sure, EQ, I suppose - but I use phones with so many different types of devices and setups that I personally really need the basic flat sonic profile of the headphone to be livable as is. I also find you get into horrible second-guessing and diminishing returns, quick, if you open that \"I can just EQ everything to my liking\" Pandora's box.\n\nSo for these reasons, I'm not convinced you can, or really should, live with the Zeros fulltime or have them as your primary listening source. What they offer at the top end is, honestly, *not* that special on its own - it does not have any unusual \"magic\" or secret spice. It's simply the same basic top end that I've heard in a number of other IEMs and earbuds at a similar price point - it's good, it's clear, it's reasonable, it does sound nice and enjoyable, but it's nothing special, nothing game-changing.\n\n...Meanwhile, though, I suspect the weird, scooped bass will cause most listeners - no matter how much they doth protest that they're \"not a basshead\" (horror of horrors!!!! who would ever want to be labeled with such an epithet!!!!!) - to turn these up louder than they ought over time. You can get to the bass in the Zeros, but you need to get over natural psychoacoustic limitations / biases such as the well-known Fletcher-Munson curve to get it there.\n\nThat means some users will have a propensity to crank these a few dB higher than they ought. I personally find that, because they are bass-shy in even the mid-bass, they are really not very satisfying to listen to with any genre until they're turned up a little. And listen, I'm not a basshead either. But I know you need to have *some* bass information to comprehend harmonic structures in the music you're listening to.\n\nAnd speaking of music-geek talk, the main use cases I can think for the Zeros would be a) for monitoring reference - though they are not nearly so bassless or horrific-sounding, these would give you at least some idea of what your mix sounds like on a phone or laptop speaker as you're making it - and b) for serious notation / transcription work. Clearing all that stuff out from 200 on down does have the interesting side effect of making it easier to hear certain details above that point. I think that's where people are getting confused on these. They suddenly hear all this stuff they never heard before! Well, guess what - for roughly the same cash, I can slap on a set of ZSTs or my Final E1000s and hear all the same stuff, plus a bit more of the bassline.\n\nI will say that the Zeros are very pretty, though! (I have them in the robin's-egg blue. They look great with the orange eartips!) I'm honestly going to keep them just for the looks and for the occasional \"well this is gonna be different\" reference in my own mixes.",

			"body": "I am not an audiophile by any means and have difficulty detecting and describing audio characteristics that IEM designers put so much effort into. I also had not tried other IEMs, and basically got these because of all the recommendations on YouTube. I was previously using budget earbuds that I would replace every few years, so this is mostly a comparison to that genre of product. My go-to earbuds were Panasonic ErgoFits (ASIN: B003EM8008).\n\nThe Zeros are definitely an upgrade. Music sounds noticeably better through the Zeros than the buds, especially when the volume is up for more active listening. Other reviewers sometimes describe the Zeros as having a flat response with extra presence on the treble side, which seems like the case to my lo-fi ears. I definitely prefer evenness and clarity over heavy bass drowning everything else out or screaming / fatiguing treble. Changing tips does make a difference, with a snug fit in the ear sounding the best. The quality of the components on the Zeros - shells, tips, and cable - is higher than I am used to. I like the cable - it has a nice braided copper look, is the right amount of pliable, is detachable / replaceable, and it loops around the ear to prevent the tips from popping out (which was a constant annoyance with the buds). The shape of the shells is a little quirky, but I find them comfortable enough to wear for hours. After about a year of use, I haven't had any problems with reliability. All in all, I enjoy these a lot.\n\nI noticed that a version 2 of the Zeros is now available, and there are some other highly regarded budget options like the Kiwi Ears Cadenza and Tangzu Wan'er as well. It would be nice to A/B some of these, and some more expensive high end ones, to really get a sense of how they differ and by how much. But for about $20-24, the Zeros seem to be a pretty safe choice as a first step into the IEM world.",

I was looking for an IEM that has a similar tuning to Grado headphones, which I recently re-discovered, having giving up on them long ago due to discomfort. I wouldn't say that these IEMs sound anything like my Grados, if anything, they might be more like Beyerdynamic. The tuning, in my opinion is oriented toward crispness, not clarity. I find the mids to be very lacking. That said, with a touch of EQ they absolutely sing. If you're going to use them un-EQ'd or with a variety of different devices where it's not convenient to have different EQ profiles, I'd recommend getting the ZERO :2s, which are more neutral, though less exciting. These ones certainly have that excitement factor and an audiophile feel to them. I don't find them fatiguing, but out-of-the box they simply don't sound good to my ear for all types of music due to how thin, crisp, and trebly they are. For certain Jazz recordings, they sounded great to me flat, but with Rock music, it's just too much cymbals and hi-hat for me, and buries a lot of important mid frequencies. With various types of Electronic music, I preferred the ZERO :2s.",

(note: even though the cord does go over your ear, it doesn’t have to sit right close to it, sometimes it’ll be more comfortable that way.)\n\ni did take a star off for the cord’s lifespan, which is pretty much my only con. UPDATE: IT WAS THE ADAPTER I WAS USING THAT GAVE ME THE ISSUE OF PAUSING RANDOMLY/NOT PLAYING\n\nnovember 28 update: i think i blew the speakers on these… bc all of a sudden i’m having to play these super loudly to hear at a comfortable level. i’ve streamed 22.2k minutes of music with these, courtesy of stats.fm, so i think that’s a pretty good lifespan for $20 earbuds.\n\ntldr: these are amazing for the $20/$25 dollar price range, good passive noise control, absolutely incredibly sound, much better than your normal earbuds.",

Definitely exceeded expectations for $25.",

I was mistaken, these did both.\n\nI currently use these with steelseries sonar EQ and an old logitech usb dongle that is sadly/surprisingly better than my on board audio which is unable to handle interference from my GPU. The resolution on these is good enough to hear a bad source and that is to their credit, on the shp9500 I could barely make out a soft hum, with these I can hear my GPU ramp up. This is a fault with the realtek chip on my motherboard, so for now, my IEMs identify as logitech G430s lol. Good chance your on board chip won't be faulty, but it is something to keep in mind.\n\nI would be very impressed indeed, if any gaming headset under 200 dollars can better these paired with a fifine usb condenser mic.\n\nThe only con is the lack of big booming bass that so many gaming centric audio products focus on. These do not have that, they are far more balanced and as a result the mids and highs have more texture. This is not a con at all IMO as the better mids are where footsteps are in both Val and CS:GO/2 are and a balanced profile prevents them from getting hidden. This is why my SHP9500s were better than every gaming headset I had previous to them.\n\nAlso, as nice as wireless is, I like products that don't feature non replaceable batteries. Had gone to full wireless and now back to fully wired with no regrets.",

On April 11, 2023 you left the following review of our product:\n-----------------------\nVery inexpensive, decent sound\nThese are pretty darn good for the money. They show a bit too much tendency to be sibilant for my tastes though. But, a very good entry point for future audiophiles!\n-----------------------\nWe’d like to address any issues or concerns you have. Your satisfaction is important so please contact us by replying to this email and we’ll work to resolve your issues.\nBest regards,\nLinsoul\nPlease note – sellers are not allowed to ask for a customer’s personal information including email or phone number: and you are not expected to change your review due to this outreach or any potential resolution.\n---\nHello, Thanks for the reply, I really don't have any issues with these and they sound very good for the price. I generally use much more expensive earphones and headphones, so I am comparing them to those units (ie, HiFiMan HE6se V2, Sennheiser HD700s, HiFiMan RE800s, and FiiO FH7s as far as the sound quality and sibilant tendencies. But, for the price you have a very good product that should compete strongly in it's price range.\nApr 12, 2023 9:06 PM\nFeel free to append this message to my review if you feel it would help. I do not consider the tendency to be sibilant a reason not to consider these IEMs if they are in the price range a customer is looking to spend, I do not feel you will get better at this price point. (I have taken the liberty to append this to my review because I was so impressed, thanks Linsoul!)\n\nAnd Now I can't wait to try their 7Hz Salnotes Timeless 14.2mm Planar IEMs when I get the money, thanks again for caring, Linsoul!",
