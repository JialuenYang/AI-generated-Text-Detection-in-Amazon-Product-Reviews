			"body": "I bought the JT Eaton 409 Jaws Indoor Plastic Mouse Trap, attracted by its design and the option for solid or liquid bait. Despite their promising appearance, the traps have been disappointing. On three separate occasions, mice were able to eat the peanut butter I used as bait without triggering the trap.\n\nWhile the concept and design of these traps look great, their effectiveness is questionable based on my experience. I plan to continue trying a bit longer, but so far, I'm unimpressed. If the situation doesn't improve, I might have to explore other options.",
