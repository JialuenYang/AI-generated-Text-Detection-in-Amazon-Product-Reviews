			"body": "This watch really has all you need. I was a Polar lover before my switch to Garmin and it's certainly an upgrade, even at what they're calling an 'entry level' running watch. Here's what I love about it:\n1. 24/7 wrist based heart rate monitoring. Very accurate during inactive and active periods.\n2. 1 week battery life with all systems on GO. I haven't stress tested it with multiple runs but so far I'm reasonably happy with the battery. It's connected to my phone so I'm receiving notifications often and my heart rate is constantly monitored.\n3. Accurate GPS tracking, with 3 options depending on your situation and demands on accuracy.\n4. Great sleep tracking. You get a lot of great insights that can be used to make adjustments, improve sleep and optimize recovery.\n5. Body battery is an interesting feature that allows you to identify when you're fully charged and ready to go and when you're drained and need to rest.\n6. VO2 max and race predictor are great features that allow you to see when you are with your fitness and at your current levels of fitness the expected race times you'd likely hit.\n7. Fitness age is an eye opening feature that determines your age based on your fitness and body weight. Gave me a harsh reality check!\n8. Lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear! You won't even remember it's on your wrist.\n\nThe watch has more features, but for me all the above is what I depend on and thoroughly enjoy! For it's price point I say it's absolute value for me. I'm very happy with my purchase.",

			"body": "I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.\n\nThis watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.\n\nI didn't want another \"smart\" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.",

			"title": "11-month review",
			"body": "Thanks to this watch, I was able to drop the 20+ pounds I put on during my post-covid depression. It got me moving again and whereas the original daunting number of 10k steps in a day made me nervous, I now walk around 23k steps daily without even thinking about it. The challenges on the app have helped me move from my former weight loss goals to my present toning ones and suffice it to say, all of this has helped tremendously with my mental health as well.\nAs for the watch features, I was looking at all sorts of brands and all kinds of models and settled on this one and never looked back. I needed a time teller, a pedometer and a heart rate monitor, in no specific order. I received all of those and more with this wrist decor. Not only does the watch look nice and feel weightless on my skin when adjusted correctly, but it works so well at everything it was made to.\nThe heart rate monitor is very accurate when compared with other heart rate monitoring devices. It's simple to clean although I was afraid of damaging something whilst attempting to clear out the 'gunk' around the plug-in site. I didn't purchase the watch for the sleep related feature but it is an interesting bonus. After roughly 9-10 months of continuous 24-hour use, I finally started noticing it act up during my treadmill workouts. My heart rate would drop to 0 and at one point I saw it jump to 248. Since I wasn't dead or dying during any of these times, I thought I'd start turning it off at night and I haven't noticed the issue since. It could have just been an error that required an update but like I said, I didn't buy for the sleep feature anyhow.\nThe battery life is pretty good I'd say. When I told my husband one day that I should 'charge my watch tonight because it's been a couple weeks' he was really surprised. I keep track on my exercise calendar whenever I feel the need to plug in, which I do during the night so it doesn't interrupt my steps during the day. I normally charge once it hits somewhere in the 20's percentile. This takes (me specifically) two weeks to accomplish, with roughly an hour and a half, minimum, of recorded activities at least five days a week and the watch otherwise just being turned on consistently. Of course, there are extra outings that warrant using the start button once in a while and yet I still find my charge schedule to remain the same.\nYou can choose from a variety of watch faces that come standard but I definitely have enjoyed looking through the Garmin store at other options. The background I've used for quite some time now shows the moon in its current state and as a lifetime star gazer, this is a face I was more than happy to throw money at. I spent just a few dollars and received something around 10 different looks, several animated such as plants or flowers that grow or open as you complete your steps for the day- amazing, if you like that sort of thing, turns out I do.\nOverall, I love my watch and I hope it lasts me a good, long time but if and when it finally dies from time cancer, I'll be sure to replace it with another Garmin. I hear there are Star Wars versions out there that I'd love to get my wrist into.",

			"body": "I've had this watch for almost a month and its been fantastic. GPS and heart rate are accurate, display is sharp (albeit not AMOLED level crisp), and the stats are just what I need/want. The question for you is will this watch meet your needs, wants, and lifestyle?\n\nWith the release of the Forerunner 165, it *seems* the 55 isn't a great choice. The 165 has an AMOLED display, an altimeter, and a few more bells and whistles for about 40 bucks more. The upgraded screen and altimeter make it seem like an easy choice to set down the extra 40 (or 100 for portable music). However, the 55 still offers a nice value and solid features:\n\nI've found the display on this watch to be fine (even with so-so near vision). Its already helped me knock time off my pace and train for an upcoming marathon. The data provided by the 55 is detailed: the body battery, sleep data, VO2 max, fitness age, stress, running cadence, and more are probably a bit more than I want and encompass all that I need. I always run with my phone (as a Zombie's Run fan and need to be in-touch with the outside world) so having a music option or do-it-all watch isn't necessary.\n\nWhile I haven't pulled a formal training plan (I'm following the Zombie's, Run! marathon trainer which I've used before to good effect), I *could* pull a plan to my 55. Further, the 55 \"knows\" when I've gone hard on a run or had a bad night's sleep and recommends a rest day or lower effort run. All good stuff!\n\nTL:DR - the 55 is a great option for a beginner runner or experienced runner who wants some data but knows (or is honest with themselves) that they probably won't dive into too deep (e.g. pace, cadence, body battery, and sleep are all they want with a few more goodies). Its also a great choice for the person who wants a dedicated GPS watch but wears other watches during their day and is having trouble justifying a special purpose purchase.\n\nI'm still in the return window for my 55 and I'm going to keep it. The 40 dollar (+ tax) isn't a huge hurdle but I can't say that the 165 gives me enough more to turn in the 55. I'm very happy with this watch because *it meets all my needs an wants* if the same is true for you, go ahead and order this but if you want the sharper display, a bit more data, and an altimeter (really, the only thing I miss on my 55) then save up some more and go that way.",

			"body": "I bought this a few months ago and loved it but wanted to wait to write a review so I could comment on its reliability over time. So far, this thing is great. Best sports/tracking watch I have ever owned.\n\nThe battery life is as advertised. Lasts about two weeks depending on how active you are with the GPS during that timeframe. You can display the exact battery percentage, also.\n\nThe size and display area are great. It doesn't feel too big but there is plenty of room on the screen for all the important info you might need.\n\nDuring workouts: you can customize what fields are displayed for each activity. I primarily use this for running, and I like how I can adjust what I see on the screen (HR, pace in whatever units I want, total distance, etc). There are actually quite a few different metrics you can display, so I'm confident you will find what you want. I also like how it vibrates at every mile marker and gives you a quick read out of how you're doing so far in terms of pace and whatever else you decide to display. The vibration is actually quite useful, and is powerful enough that you will definitely feel it (I know some watches are sort of weak in this regard).\n\nHeartbeat sensor: this was an important one for me, and this watch has performed very well in this regard. My older Garmin watch (Forerunner 35 I think?) seemed pretty unreliable with HR, but this one seems like its pretty spot on most of the time (as verified by manually checking my HR to see how close it is).\n\nIt has some really cool \"widgets\" that you can add to your main menu. For example, I can check the weather for the next week with two or three button presses, which I think is a cool bonus. It also has health focused ones like V02 max and you can review your HR over the past week, displayed as a simple line graph.\n\nThe only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that when you go to start a workout, a run for example, it will always give you this \"suggested workout\" that you have to say no to every time. It's really annoying and I wish I could turn it off, it just adds extra button presses before I can start my run. Not enough to deduct any points, but it's still a really annoying feature.",

			"body": "So I'm a creature of habit and if something isn't broken I usually don't fix it. That being said, I've had a Garmin Forerunner 310XT since 2011 and its more than served its purpose. I've noticed its become rather cumbersome on my wrist and the strap recently broke......Time to upgrade.\n\nThat led me to do some research on GPS watches and I saw this one on sale. I didn't need anything crazy expensive as all I needed it for was my running activity.\n\nI ended up buying the 55 due to it being on sale. It took me a little while playing with it to figure out all the features, but it only took me an hour or so. Its pretty easy to figure out.\n\nI barely know I have it on my wrist unlike my old clunky 310XT. No more heartrate chest strap!! It detects heartrate with sensors on the watch!!\n\nCoolest feature is that my wife can live time track me during my runs and see exactly where I am and if anything were to happen to me, she would be notified. She can see my heartrate, pace, and numerous other stats. Knowing that she is watching me, forces me to push myself harder on my runs, haha!!\n\nBattery last a long time, shows my sleep pattern, can easily read the watch face during activity and has all the features I need in a GPS watch and more.\n\n100% recommend especially while its on sale!!",

			"body": "I've had this watch for 10 months, and I'm ready for a better watch. This watch isn't all bad though.\nIf you're looking for a cheaper option for running watches this is a pretty good choice, as long as your milage is reasonable. Obviously of you're running more mileage you're charging your watch more often. If I don't use the watch for anything but \"being a watch\" and heart rate monitoring I could get a couple weeks between charges. The gps seems pretty accurate, I have routes that I usually run and the watch is pretty close in marking miles in about the same spot, I'd say within .05 of a mile, worse case.\nI'd say this watch is more geared towards cardio workouts, I use the \"other\" while I'm weight lifting and it's not quite the right option, but theres no other options for this watch. It also does not have the ability to do elevation. Any elevation in your run is gps based i think.\nThe watch itself is very durable, I only have the tiniest chip in the top of the screen, I wear this watch all the time, except while showering. The screen has minimal scratching. I've bought the screen covers for this watch before, but no brand I've ever bought was the exact correct size and there was always a small edge pulled up that would get dirt under it and it would eventually fall off.\nI really like that the screen is NOT touch screen and only the buttons control it. I don't have to worry about accidentally bumping something during a work out.\nI'm not sure how accurate the HR is, I caveat that I wear my watch on the inside of my wrist and I have dark tattooing there that could cause some problems. But I've also worn it on the opposite side of my wrist and had similar readings. You also can't wear this watch tight against the skin, then it won't read a HR at all. I've seen this happen in work outs where there a missing HR chunks of time.\nThe sleep monitoring is NOT reliable. Like at all. Basically all it knows it that your heart rate is lowering and it's night time. I can be sitting still reading before bed and it counts all that time as sleep. So where I might have actually slept midnight to 630, my watch started counting sleep at 10. So I says I've gotten more sleep. Therefore effecting your \"body battery\" rate.\nThe charger is weird. It takes a special charger, which I've bought another one for my travel bag. And if the watch charging interface gets dirty it makes charging finicky.\nThe phone finder is really useful and I do like the period tracker.",

The rate will stay too low for the entire activity; ending and restarting the activity seems to fix this but due to the inconsistency it’s easy to miss if I’m not looking for it during the activity.\n\nChecking the forums there are other reports of sensor recording being to low for slower paced activities with this model, it’s not a deal breaker but if you use/focus on the Intensity Minutes feature this can cause you to miss goals (editing/adding your accurate rate doesn’t add these minutes after the activity is ended).",

Luckily the watch itself gives hints on the customization features.
