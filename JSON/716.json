These 1.1LB organic hemp seeds are packed with plant-based protein and essential Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, making them the perfect addition to any diet.\n\nWhat impressed me the most about these hemp seeds was the fact that they are 100% organic and non-GMO. As someone who values clean and natural products, I appreciate that En Avant takes the extra step to ensure their hemp seeds are free from harmful chemicals and genetic modifications.\n\nI also love that these hemp seeds are hulled, making them easier to digest and incorporate into my meals. They have a slightly nutty flavor which adds a delicious and nutritious boost to my smoothies, yogurt and salads. I have even tried using them as a topping for oatmeal and they added a nice crunch and flavor.\n\nOne of the main reasons I incorporate hemp seeds into my diet is for their high protein content. As a vegetarian, it can sometimes be challenging to find plant-based sources of protein but these hemp hearts provide a nourishing and sustainable option. They are also a great source of fiber, helping to keep me feeling full and satisfied.\n\nI also appreciate that these hemp seeds are gluten-free and vegan, making them suitable for a variety of dietary restrictions. This makes them a great option for anyone looking to add more plant-based foods to their meals.\n\nIn addition to being a nutritious superfood, En Avant Hemp Seeds are also sustainably sourced and environmentally friendly. This is important to me as I try to make conscious choices in my purchasing.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend En Avant Hemp Seeds to anyone looking for a healthy and delicious addition to their diet. Whether you are a health-conscious individual, a vegetarian or simply looking to improve your overall well-being, these hemp seeds are a fantastic choice. I will definitely be repurchasing and making them a staple in my pantry.",
