The battery life is also great, so there is not much downtime that I have to charge it up. The motion sensitivity is exactly where I want it, as security is my top priority. Its integration with Alexa, the phone app, and portability of the accompanying chime let me know if anyone is approaching the house, no matter where I am.",
