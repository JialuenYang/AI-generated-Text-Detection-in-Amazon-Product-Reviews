			"title": "Real Grade Epyon",
			"body": "This kit felt great to build, not too difficult and came out looking great. The transformation is simple and doesn't compromise the rest of the model kit like the RG Zeta Gundam. The kit looks slightly different from the anime, but the changes look good (little dragon mouths on the feet that can open when in flight mode, slightly different wings, etc.) Great color separation too. The heat whip of the kit also comes as one pre-molded piece which makes it so that you don't have to tediously assemble each section of the whip, makes the whip feel stronger, and easy to set in dynamic poses by rotating pieces of the whip. Accessory-wise the kit only comes with a beam saber, shield, and heat whip; but that's because the Epyon didn't really use anything else so it wouldn't make sense to include a rifle or other handheld weapon. Comes with a large sticker sheet for adding additional superfluous details, although the piece for the eyes is color correct which allows you to skip applying those annoying eye stickers if you choose which is a nice bonus.",

			"title": "Absolute peak of gunpla design",
			"body": "RG Epyon is beyond any doubt a top of the line gunpla kit. Aesthetically, color separation is on point, it's overall looks are simply fantastic and has some of the best light piping yet in gunpla. The build its also a lot of fun, though some small pieces may be a little tough to deal with for beginners. Articulation is great, not only is it highly posable but the build is sturdy as a rock. Just a great kill all around.",

Waterslide decals would likely look better, but the sticker decals look perfectly fine, in my opinion. The finished product is gorgeous and you’ll love it if you buy it. It’s super pose-able. Doesn’t require a stand to display. Even the wings are poseable. This kit is amazing.",

And as silly as I find the Mobile Armor mode, (two headed dragon mode) it's a simple and effective transformation. It's a must buy in my opinion. Just watch the price and wait for it to normalize, though. New Gunpla tends to be a bit pricey on Amazon.",
