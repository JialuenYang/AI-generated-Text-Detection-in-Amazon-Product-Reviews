      "body": "I recently tried the OGX Radiant Glow + Argan Oil of Morocco Extra Hydrating Body Wash, and it has been a delightful addition to my shower routine. The moisturizing properties and enchanting scent make it a standout product, though I do have a minor wish for more lather.\n\nFirst and foremost, the scent is absolutely amazing! It's like a spa experience in a bottle, and the lingering fragrance leaves me feeling refreshed and invigorated. The Argan Oil of Morocco adds a luxurious touch, and I appreciate that the scent is not overpowering but rather subtle and delightful.\n\nThe hydrating properties of the body wash are evident. My skin feels noticeably softer and smoother after each use, and I've experienced a significant improvement in overall hydration. It's a fantastic choice for those with dry skin, and I love the fact that it's paraben-free and sulfate-free.\n\nWhile the moisturizing effect is top-notch, I found that the lathering could be improved. It takes a bit more product than I anticipated to achieve the desired lather. I wish the formula could create a richer lather without requiring a larger amount of product, as this would enhance the overall experience. The 19.5 fl oz size is generous and offers good value for the price. The dispenser is practical and makes for easy use in the shower.\n\nIn conclusion, the OGX Radiant Glow + Argan Oil of Morocco Body Wash is a fantastic choice for those seeking hydration and a heavenly scent.",
