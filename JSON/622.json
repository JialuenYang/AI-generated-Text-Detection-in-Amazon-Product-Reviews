The texture was crisp and refreshing, and the size of the grapes was consistently large and plump. They were also incredibly fresh, staying firm and flavorful even after a few days in the fridge. Whether enjoyed on their own or added to a fruit salad, these Green Seedless Grapes were a hit with the whole family. Iâ€™ll definitely be buying them again!",
