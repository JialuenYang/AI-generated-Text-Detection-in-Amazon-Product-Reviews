			"body": "We purchased these dance tights with high hopes, drawn in by their softness and comfort. However, after a couple of uses in our toddler's ballet class, these tights have left us with mixed feelings and a two-star rating.\n\nThe initial appeal of these tights is their ultra-soft texture, which feels wonderful against the skin. Unfortunately, that softness seems to come at the cost of durability. After a few wears, we noticed that they began to stretch out, which is a problem, especially for an active toddler like ours.\n\nThe breaking point came when our toddler experienced a fall during ballet class. To our disappointment, a visible hole appeared on her knee after this minor mishap. It's disheartening to see such a quick deterioration in the quality of the tights, as they are specifically designed for dance and should be able to withstand a bit of wear and tear.\n\nIn summary, while these dance tights may offer initial comfort, they fall short in terms of durability. Their tendency to stretch out and the ease with which they develop holes after minor incidents have left us dissatisfied with their performance. If you're looking for dance tights that can endure the rigors of active movement, these may not be the best choice for your little one.",
