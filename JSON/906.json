			"body": "Oh, brace yourselves, fellow backpack aficionados, because the YOREPEK Extra Large 50L Laptop Backpack has just waltzed into the scene, and boy, is it turning heads! This backpack is so impressive; I feel like it should come with its own theme music.\n\nLet me tell you, it's not just a backpack; it's practically a portable universe. I'm convinced it has its own gravitational pull because it attracts everything you need and then some. Move over Mary Poppins, there's a new bag in town!\n\nCapacity for Days:\nThe 50L capacity is basically the TARDIS of backpacks. It's like Hermione's bottomless bag, but without the pesky magic. You can throw in your laptop, clothes, snacks, a small kitchen sink - it'll fit. I think I could probably fit my entire life in there, and it would still have room for a picnic.\n\nOrganization Goals:\nThe organizers of this backpack deserve a medal. They've thought of everything - from a dedicated laptop compartment that cradles your precious gadget like a baby to the front compartment with more pockets than a kangaroo has pouches. There's even a keychain design that makes me feel like a secret agent every time I pull out my keys.\n\nWater-Resistant Wizardry:\nRain, spills, accidental water fights – this backpack laughs in the face of moisture. It's more water-resistant than a duck in a rainstorm. My laptop has never felt safer, and my snacks have never been more secure. It's like having a waterproof fortress on your back.\n\nMesh Pockets Galore:\nThe two side mesh pockets are a game...oops, let's not use that word. They're a game-enjoyer! Perfect for water bottles, umbrellas, or smuggling in a little plant to add some greenery to your life. It's the little things, you know?\n\nIn conclusion, this backpack is not just a purchase; it's an investment in your happiness, organization, and possibly your survival during unexpected adventures. So, do yourself a favor – click that 'Add to Cart' button and join the elite club of YOREPEK enthusiasts. Your back will thank you, and your life might just become a tad more organized and entertaining. 5 stars, no doubt!",

Just don’t forget you have to buy your own power pack to charge stuff up but otherwise it looks really cool and useful ten billion pockets so you just have to remember where you put what.\nMarch 2024 if I don’t respond back it means I forgot to update this as the backpack did wonderful on his trip",

			"title": "Durable & Versatile",
			"body": "Got this in September. These past 3 months I've used it for trans-Atlantic flight to England, trans-Pacific flight to Japan, 7 day trip to Disney in Orlando as well as a couple road trips for racing events. So far, it has held up nicely. Had up to 35-40lbs worth of gear in it with no issues.\n\nPro's: Durable. Comfortable. LOTS of storage compartments & they are easy to get to & use. Has pass-through slots for cables from your battery to your device. Decent enough padding for your electronics. Multiple pockets of varying sizes for different needs. Bottle holders work great & have straps to clip taller bottles in. Side straps can be used to buckle in hoodies or jackets/wind breakers. carry handle is very stiff & solid - hung loaded bag from it on a hook with no issues.\n\nCon's: TOO many pockets - easy to lose track of WHERE you put stuff! Lots of zippers - would be nice if they were colored (the black zippers blend in w the black backpack making it hard to find in low light). The 2 vertical pockets on either side near the bottle holders are narrow - if you have large hands, it's hard to get down to the bottom for small items. Would be really nice if it had a chest strap to connect the 2 shoulder harnesses - have that on my old backpack & really like that feature, especially for heavier loads. Would be a \"5-Star\" review if not for those last 2 items.\n\nAll in all, a really good travel backpack for the money.",

			"title": "3+ years later, this backpack is still going strong",
			"body": "I've had this backpack since 2019 and I've taken it to quite a few places. The first time I ordered it, the zippers immediately broke so I was sent a replacement, but I haven't had any issues since. The zippers, mesh, pockets, etc. all are running very smoothly, even though I'm a chronic over-stuffer.\n\nIn the beginning of 2019, I packed this backpack and took it to Europe for about three months. It was my only luggage as I traveled cross-country via bus and plane, hostels and hotel rooms. Conclusion? This thing is HEFTY and can fit a lot of stuff.\n\nOver the years, I've used it as my carry-on luggage for what amounts to maybe 30-40 trips now, and I also use it for short local weeklong trips, too. When it's overstuffed, it's too big to fit below the seat, so I mostly used it as an upper bin bag. It's slammed along the bottom of over a dozen bus carriages, trekked through wet, humid, and dry conditions, and it still looks great. I'd say it's even stretched out a few inches over the years.\n\nHere are a few things you should know:\n- I wore this as I walked the misty, rainy streets of Edinburgh and the clothes inside remained dry.\n- I've had to run to catch planes in-between quick layovers, sweating as I raced to catch my plane, and the straps have excellent wicking capabilities, because it's never smelled.\n\nThere is a clamshell backing compartment that opens completely flat which is great for electronics. For me, it fits all of this:\n-12.5\" Dell laptop\n-11\" MacBook with padded holder\n-A paperback book or 1-2 magazines\n- 8\" tablet reader\nI can also sometimes cram my laptop fan, but sometimes not, if I pack too many clothes.\nThat compartment is about 2.5\" W x 17\"H closed. Frankly, it doesn't have a lot of give, so I try not to add additional items to that side.\n\n-There are two pockets in the side that have zippers, usually I add water bottles here, but you could also add shoes or dirty socks inside the zippered areas.\n\n-The largest compartment measures around 6.5\" W x 16\" H, though it has stretched out over the years.\n\nHere's a sample of clothes I can pack here when rolled them; rolled and wrapped a measuring tape around each piece of clothing to get the diameter, then measured the height (before I squish it all together):\n-1 pair of sweat pants 10\" x 4\"\n-1 sweater 9\" x 3.5\"\n-2 pairs of pants, one at 11\" x 4\" and 10\" x 3.5\"\n-1 sweater dress at 10\" x 6\"\n-1 pair of tights at 5\" x 3\"\n-1 sweater at 11\" x 6\"\nThen a packing cube with various undergarments (3 pairs of socks, 3 pairs of underwear) and two long-sleeved shirts at 11\" x 4.5\"\n-And that leaves an empty space for more at 7\" x 5\" I put a few pairs of socks and a Google Nest in, but it's still not packed snuggly.\n-Then there's an additional flap, where I usually add a small toiletry bag with soap, shampoo, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.\n-There's another small clamshell pocket where you can put pens, and there's a key ring so your keys don't get lost inside your bag.\n-There's an additional zippered pocket where I put my passport and extra TSA locks.\n\nThere are straps on each side that I've pre-measured out so that if I want, I can fit the bag under a domestic airline seat. With all of the above mentioned, there's room to spare for a few more things.\nInstead of adding toiletries to the end pockets, they would fit at the top of the pack and make it nice and snug. Enough clothes for 3-7 days, easily, depending on what you pack.\n-And to the handle, I'll usually wrap a scarf and neck pillow, or a jacket for the flight.\n\nAnd here are your caveats:\n-The more you pack those two deep pockets (clothes and electronics), the less space you'll have to pack anything else in the extra pockets.\n-If packing for underneath a seat, you can't have much in any of the other pockets or side mesh holders.\n-The bag is designed so you have to put some things in each of the two large compartments, you can't just fill up the larger one with clothes. It will gap and you'll find you're wasting space.\n-The straps are very thick and not particularly comfortable, especially when the bag is full, for a smaller frame like mine (5'3\").\n\nRecently, I'm entertaining the idea of switching out this backpack because of my own back lol. I need to downgrade to a rolling checked bag and get a smaller, lightweight backpack for my electronics since I WFH now and need to bring a bit more gear than I used to. But I continue to take this pack when I'm spending the night somewhere for a few days, and I would definitely consider taking it on a short trip if I didn't need to bring my work equipment.\n\nMaybe I'll come back in a couple of years and let you know how I'm using it at that time!",

			"title": "Big, waterproof, reliable",
			"body": "I bought this backpack before embarking on a 2 year masters degree which requires me to travel across Europe every few months. I bought it bc I am not capable of packing lightly and wanted a big backpack w many pockets that I can shove full as a carry on- and it works perfectly for that.\nHowever I decided to write this review bc I recently moved to Bergen Norway. It rains every single day. This has also become my university backpack, although it’s a bit big to just carry my laptop and water bottle and snacks.. but I don’t have another one. Anyway, it holds up so well in the rain. Granted I haven’t had it long, but my laptops and books and everything else stay dry inside even when the rain soaks through my jacket and sweater..\nThere’s no signs of wear yet and I’ve used it daily for months. When I shove it full for travel, I REALLY shove it full, and no signs of wear from that either. When it’s only carrying a few things, I like that I can cinch it up with side straps / clips so the empty pockets don’t gape out and it makes the whole thing slimmer.\nOverall I’m very impressed w the quality considering it’s from Amazon and not some name brand, which would be much more expensive. Definitely recommend this backpack, it’s a huge bargain but performs like any other high quality name brand backpack. Very happy with it.",

			"body": "This bag has INSANE space. I packed a ps5, portable monitor, 65% keyboard, wireless mouse, change of clothes, cables, chargers, 2 battery banks, keys, misc electronics, a Steam Deck and MULTIPLE controllers (Gamecube, 2 PS5, Switch) into this thing and it all fit pretty comfortably. Insane. I have back problems but even with all these things packed in with how it distributes the weight with the different sized pockets and the great shoulder straps, I had very little issues carrying this thing. Would be much better with a chest strap to help even more, but otherwise this thing is amazing.\n\nNo issues with the security lock and I love having that option there for the bigger electronics pocket. I really love having the USB pass-through that lets me keep my battery bank in the inside pocket to charge my phone from the bag itself without having to dig through it. When I store it I hang it from the handle on the top and I was worried about that tearing, but it's been hanging for 3 months with some light cables and books in it and all that's happened is the handle warped a bit. No fraying on the fabric or signs of damage.\n\nI just love this bag so much and I hope it lasts me a long time. Fingers crossed!!",

			"body": "Bought this backpack for $40 back in September 2022 on Amazon. I've consistently used it throughout the years holding at least 30 lbs of laptops and equipment around.\n\nThe only visible damage has been on one of the straps tearing at the seams 6 months ago from the repeated abuse but considering it's been 2 years and it's still functional and I use it daily, I would say it's served it's purpose even if the aesthetic had deteriorated.\n\nThe straps for tightening have been finicky at times, sometimes slipping altogether while wearing it, but this could be due to pushing the bag to it's limits.\n\nI haven't had a problem ever with any of the zippers and I've consistently over stuffed the bag to a point where it looked like it would bust. That's probably the most impressive.\n\nOverall, the bag is pretty spacious. All of the pockets within the smallest pocket are useful. It's definitely great bang for your buck, but I'll now move to something more heavy duty. If you need a bag for like academic or work use and you won't overstuff it or strain the straps with heavy loads, this bag will get it done and probably never get to the point mine has.",
