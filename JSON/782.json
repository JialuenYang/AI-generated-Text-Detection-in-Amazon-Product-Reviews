			"body": "I recently purchased this liner and am absolutely thrilled with its performance. This simple yet ingenious addition has transformed my air frying experience entirely.\n\nThe silicon liner fits perfectly in my air fryer basket, providing a non-stick surface that makes cleanup an absolute breeze. No more scrubbing and scraping off stuck-on food! I love that I can simply remove the liner, give it a quick wash, and it's ready to go for the next cooking session.\n\nThe only thing I didn't account for is cook time. It seems like most recipes need to go slightly longer in order to crisp them up. But I'm learning how to adjust.",
