			"body": "The Square POS Stand is a breeze to set up – the process is self-explanatory and hassle-free. However, it’s worth noting that it requires a wall-plugged power source, which might be inconvenient for businesses on the go, like mine that operates at anime conventions, dance events, and concerts, especially outdoors.\n\nOn the bright side, it pairs seamlessly with a certified refurbished iPad and functions exceptionally well. If a wall-plugged power source isn’t a concern for your business, this stand is a solid choice for efficient and stylish transactions.",
