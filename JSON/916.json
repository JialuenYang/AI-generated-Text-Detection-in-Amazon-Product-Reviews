In addition, you can plug in two USB cords at the same time. This device worked fine for me on a recent trip to NZ. However, it is a little bulky. The prongs stick out rather than retract or fold into the body.\n\nI only used this for charging small electronics (phones and i-Pads. It appears to me that it would work for something like a hair dryer, too, but it doesn't look like there is any sort of power transformer, so you would need to make sure that you US hair dryer is rated for 220V input.",

I love that it allows for multiple USB devices.\n\nNote: this is a plug adapter so US plugs can plug into non-US electrical outlets. It's perfect for small electronics that can take a range of input voltage. For example, Apple chargers take inputs from 100-240v and outputs the right charge for a particular device. It's not meant to convert power from one wattage to another. I saw some reviews saying their hairdryers and other devices were \"fried\". This convertor is not meant to convert wattage at all.",

Make sure all your electronics can use 240v because all this does is allow you to plug them in with the different electric socket. Fortunately, all of mine were ok on 240. Another thing I didn't think of is using my laptop plugged into a power strip as this is too large to use on one. Fortunately a colleague had bought a converter with many different ends and shared those (smaller) plugs with me for use on a power strip. The one thing I didn't like about this is how large it is and it doesn't collapse making it a bit bulky for sticking in your luggage. But it did work as advertised; I just needed to read better before purchasing.",

Just plug it into the Type C wall outlet (think most EU countries , but not England) and then plug in your USA device.\n\nAs noted in the description, this is not a converter, it is an adapter. If your USA device only works with 110 current (typically hair dryers, irons, etc), then this will not work as you need to purchase a converter. If your electrical item says 100V to 250V, this unit will work just fine.\n\nMany electronics used today have USB charging wires (think cell phones, fitbit, kindle, etc). Having 2 USB ports in addition to the 2 electric outlets is a HUGE convenience.\n\nMy only \"wish\" would be if the 2 prong plug folded down to take up less space when traveling. But in fairness, the product description never implied that it folded down - it just would have been a \"nice to have\" feature",
