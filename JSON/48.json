      "body": "The Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug in Smoky Blue is an absolute game-changer when it comes to keeping beverages hot! I've been using this mug for a while now, and I'm continually impressed by its ability to maintain the temperature of my drinks throughout the day.\n\nThis mug is perfect for those who enjoy their beverages piping hot, as it keeps them almost too hot for hours on end. In fact, I've found myself needing to let my drink cool down before taking a sip, which is a testament to the mug's incredible insulation capabilities.\n\nHowever, I must admit that its ability to retain heat can be almost annoying at times, as the contents never seem to cool down to a comfortable drinking temperature. But for those who prioritize hot beverages, this feature is undoubtedly a plus.\n\nIn addition to its impressive thermal insulation, the mug is also well-designed and durable. The smoky blue color adds a touch of elegance, and the stainless steel construction feels sturdy and reliable.\n\nOne thing to note is that, as with any vacuum-insulated container, it's essential to be cautious when using carbonated beverages. My son learned this the hard way when he put carbonated water in the mug, causing it to pass by the internal seal. However, this was more of a user error than a flaw with the mug itself.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug to anyone looking for a reliable and long-lasting travel mug that keeps beverages hot for hours on end. Just be prepared for drinks that stay hot, almost annoyingly so!",
