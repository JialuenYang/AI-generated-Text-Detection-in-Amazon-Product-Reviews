			"body": "As the second iteration of the Apple Watch Ultra, most of the capabilities in the watch are well-known at this point. It's chunky, but high-tech. If you're in the Apple ecosystem, it's an amazing way to get alerts, unlocks your Macbook since it stays authenticated as long as it's touching your skin and can be an auth token, and measure non-medical-grade health metrics. The battery life is great. Many days the battery only drops 10-20% for a full 12 hours use. I use it to ping my misplaced iPhone in the sofa cushions all the time.\n\nThe biggest reason for me getting the Ultra 2 vs. the non-Ultra Apple Watches is to use it as a SCUBA backup. computer. It's accurate on depth and temperature as compared to my Suunto Eon Steel. The screen is bright and easy to read. Things like haptic safety stops is a nice feature. I do hope they offer air integration in the future. I'm very happy with my Ultra 2. It's a daily wear item for me for casual dress and business casual. I wouldn't wear it with dresses and heels, but I don't have reasons to dress up much.",

			"body": "I have been eyeballing this watch since its Gen 1 release. I finally pulled the trigger when the rumors started that Apple might have to pull them off the shelf due to a patent infringement lawsuit. All of a sudden the prices dropped and I knew I had to buy it.\n\nThe jury is still out on the band. Don’t get me wrong, love the look and the fit. The problem is I run a lot, and the cloth band can get rather gross after several miles of running. So far I have been able to keep it pretty clean just by hand washing it, and several videos suggest you can throw it I the wash as long as you put it in a garment bag. Plus, worse case is I buy a different band, like one of the Nike rubber ones.\n\nI love the battery life. Even with super heavy use I get a good 48ish hours between charges. Now I can use my watch to track my sleep at night. Charging is also pretty fast as long as you use a 5v charger. Typical charge time seems to be around 30min if I am at 25% battery.\n\nThe titanium case is also a marked improvement. Even though it’s much larger physically than my old Apple Watch 6 it feels way lighter. And I have banged mine around a bit at the gym and on the road and it still has no noticeable scratches at all in the case or glass.",

Although I have an average size wrist, I’ve always preferred larger watches.\n\nI’ll be keeping the series 7, as it is lighter and smaller, therefore more comfortable to sleep with.

			"body": "My first Apple watch, a Gen 5, was a surprise birthday gift from my family. It wasn't something I was thinking about, as I've been a fan of analog, solar-powered watches for years. And I didn't care for the way the early Apple watches went dark when you weren't looking at them, nor the need to charge a battery every day. But I loved that Apple watch (still do, my wife now wears it happily). I found it incredibly handy, especially after moving to work-from-home due to the pandemic -- picking up phone calls and keeping up with Outlook tasks is huge. AND, weirdly, the pesky \"activity rings\" encouraged me to get back into an exercise routine (just to shut them up) and I lost weight that had been bothering me for years. As a result, I've really gotten involved in the Apple health environment, linking my scale and tracking my various measurements. It's been a great motivator to keep improving my physical shape.\n\nSo, why the big, expensive Ultra? We do like to get outdoors (kayaking and nature photography here in Florida) so I've got a use for a durable, GPS-enabled device. And that Gen 5 was a little small for my maturing eyes. This watch handles all of that, and offers even more health data (Blood O2, etc.). And it hasn't disappointed.\n\nLikes\nLooks -- important in a watch. I'm not a huge guy, but all this \"It's too BIG\" hullabaloo is nonsense. It looks terrific on my wrist and is just as comfortable to wear as the smaller Gen 5 watch (thank you, titanium/ceramic construction).\n\nProductivity -- It would be hard to go back to having to check my phone for calendar reminders, weather activity updates, etc. And even without a paid cell plan, the Ultra of course lets you answer calls on your wrist so long as your phone is nearby. It's a great help in a work-from-home environment.\n\nSo many complications!\nThe larger face on the Ultra 2 allows more complications, in a more readable fashion, and the Ultra-specific watch faces show them off to great effect. I don't know if I need to know my altitude, compass heading, number of steps, outside temp, day, date, time, battery status, and upcoming Outlook tasks all at once, but I really enjoy having that ability now.\n\nOutdoors\nI've used the Ultra for exercise tracking (works great, of course) and it's had no trouble banging around the yard, but so far no nautical outings or hikes to test the backtrack or other GPS features to track distance (and keep you from getting lost!). But I'm sure glad to have them.\n\nBattery\nI mean, more would be better, but my Gen 5 was running out of juice after about 15 hours, and the Ultra 2 is generally in the 70-80% range after the same period. I still charge it every night, but I don't worry about it giving up before then as I was starting to have to do.\n\nNot So Likes\nNone really so far. Okay, paying iPhone money for a watch is a lot. But to be fair, it's not hard to spend what the Ultra 2 costs on either a fancy outdoors watch like a Fenix/Garmin, or a more traditional high-tech watch like a Citizen, or a really nice looking watch from whomever.\n\nTo me, this one covers it all. Attractive titanium case, Sapphire crystal, water resistant enough for diving; tough enough to take out boating or hiking, all in a multi-billion-transistor wrist computer with dozens of customizable watch faces, a compass, altimeter, depth gauge, heart monitor, blood oxygen sensor, sleep and exercise tracker, appointment reminder, music player and wrist telephone. Phew.\n\nAnd yes, it tells time, more accurately than a $200,000 Rolex that can't access the Internet. And it doesn't need to be reset twice a year for Daylight Savings Time.\n\nI wish the Apple bands were more plentiful and less expensive. I got the comfy Trail Loop, but it would be nice to have the Ocean too without paying another $99. But I've been wearing my existing silicone sport bands most of the time (large Gen 5-up bands fit perfectly) and Amazon has a staggering number of Ultra-compatible watch bands available (picked up a really nice SS mesh band for business outings for $27 and a leather one for about the same).\n\nBottom line\nIf you have an iPhone, an Apple smartwatch is a no-brainer. Yes, it's another thing to charge at night, but you're already doing that. And it is almost odd how handy it is having so much information available on your wrist -- once you have it, you won't want to be without it. I also think the exercise integrations are huge, whether you're a hardcore gym rat, or just need to make sure you didn't sit in a chair all day -- being able to track your improvements is a great motivator. It's been a game changer for me. I literally exercise in part to watch my \"numbers\" improve. Weird, but true.\n\nAs for the Ultra -- the name's a bit much, and the price is steep, but if you want MORE of what Apple smart watches can do, in a bigger, more attractive, sturdier, more capable package, this is a great piece of gear. I couldn't be more pleased.\n\nFive big, smart stars.",

I used to own an Apple Watch Series 3 and was looking for an upgrade. I was either going to get a series 9 or the new Ultra 2. I ended up splurging on the ultra 2 and honestly it’s an extremely good watch. I’m personally a very clumsy person and my Series 3 looked like it has been through a war or two however, the titanium makes this watch super durable and almost resistant to dinks and scratches. Another thing the battery life! One of the best features of this watch, I usually charge the batter every 1.5 days and if I’m lucky sometimes even 2 days. The heart rate tracking pings a lot more so you’re able to get much more accurate tracking and this is great if you’re into fitness. I’m not really a diver, marathon runner, etc, but this watch for day to day use is definitely over kill. If you’re considering this watch I would just recommend you figure out your priorities on why you want it. I also love being able to use this for sleep tracking every night without needing a charge beforehand. Overall if you have the money I would say get it, but if you’re looking for a better price Series 9 or even older is the way to go.",

As I descended into the abyss, I half-expected it to transform into a mini submarine – alas, it didn't, but it did keep track of my dive time like a champ.\n\nThe underwater experience was so immersive that I almost asked Siri for the best seafood restaurants in the area. I mean, if you're going to dive deep, might as well plan a fantastic post-dive meal, right?\n\nThe water-resistant feature worked like a charm, and my watch emerged from the depths drier than a desert. I almost felt sorry for it, wondering if it missed the thrill of a good splash. Perhaps Apple should consider adding a \"water play\" mode to satisfy its aquatic cravings.\n\nNow, if only it had a fish translation app – imagine having a chat with a curious clownfish about the latest updates in the tech world. \"Have you heard about the new iPhone Fishbowl Edition?\" I'd ask. Who knows, they might be tech enthusiasts too.\n\nIn conclusion, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 isn't just a timekeeper; it's a fearless underwater companion, a potential gourmet guide, and possibly a future diplomat in the fish community.

All that to the side what is the upgrade? Almost not noticeable since whatever is included wouldn’t be useful to anyone rocking one to average locations. The only key features are that you got an increase size to the watch with supposedly a brighter screen (Haven’t notice, could be privacy screen) now you’re wondering if it’s actually worth it.\n\nIt’s probably just preference in the end cause the other essential feature is having a better battery, not having to worry about it dying at work if forgetting to charge.
