Not only does it effectively remove dead skin cells and impurities, but it also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.\n\nOne of the things I love about this product is that it is made with white rice, which is known for its brightening and softening properties. As someone with darkened skin, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall tone and texture of my skin after using this mask. It has even helped to reduce the appearance of pores and leave my skin looking more radiant.\n\nThe application process is simple and the mask has a pleasant scent. It is gentle on the skin and does not cause any irritation or redness. I also appreciate that it is safe for both men and women, making it a versatile product for everyone to use. It has has helped to soften and smooth my skin. It truly is a multi-purpose product that delivers amazing results. Plus, the 4.05 oz size is generous and will last me for a while.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the SKINFOOD Mask Rice 120g to anyone looking for an effective exfoliating scrub that is also gentle and nourishing for the skin. It's a must-have in my skincare routine and I can't wait to see even more improvements in my skin with continued use. Thank you, SKINFOOD, for this amazing product!
