			"body": "I purchased the GERIT BATT 48-11-2460 12V 6.0Ah Replacement for Milwaukee 12V Battery with hopes of upgrading from my Craftsman 19.2-volt batteries. Unfortunately, these batteries turned out to be complete junk. Not only did they fail to work as replacements, but they also brought to light the broader issue of poor quality in the Craftsman 19.2-volt line.\n\nThe GERIT BATT batteries simply did not function as advertised, leaving me with non-functional tools and a sense of frustration. While I initially hoped for an improvement over Craftsman, it appears that the problems extend beyond the specific brand.\n\nIn my experience, everything Craftsman made in the 19.2-volt line proved to be of subpar quality, and the GERIT BATT replacement batteries only compounded the disappointment. I cannot recommend these batteries to anyone seeking a reliable replacement for Craftsman 19.2-volt batteries or an upgrade in general. Save your money and look for alternatives with a better track record.",
