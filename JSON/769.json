Boxes are utility items that you need to be sturdy and you need to be easy to fold and will hold the tape that you close them with and not fall apart.

I made a move of about 2,000 miles and these boxes held up extremely well in over 2 weeks of being shipped in pods. The tape stayed gripped to the boxes even though we used three different brands of tape. I am very very happy with the purchase. They worked much better than collecting boxes from the local liquor store or supermarket.",

I called to see if the additional 6 could be sent out overnight. I was told they could only refund me half the amount since I received half of the product.

There also aren’t handles on the boxes which makes moving them more difficult. I personally like the Home Depot boxes they have extra strength options that can lift a lot of things. These boxes also don’t have an area to mark what room the stuff goes to but that’s not that big of a deal. For the price and convenience these are a good option but I still recommend going to Home Depot.",
