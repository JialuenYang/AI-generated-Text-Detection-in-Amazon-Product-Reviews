      "body": "The ARZOPA 16.1\" Portable Monitor Sleeve Bag serves as a decent extra layer of protection, albeit with a touch of irony since the monitor already comes with a case. The initial feeling is a bit odd, as the material resembles a somewhat saggy leather. While not entirely confidence-inspiring in terms of protection, it's a reasonable choice over having no additional cover or relying solely on default accessories. It adds a practical safeguard for your portable monitor during travel.",
