			"title": "An almost perfect case for AirPods",
			"body": "I got this after dropping my AirPod Pro and having the ear pieces fly all over the place, once under a heavy entertainment cabinet, but no more. This drop resistant case with a solid magnetic latch keeps the lid closed until you are ready to use it.\n\nThe case is clear with a hardened plastic around the edges allowing a solid protection against dropping and losing the AirPods while also seeing charging light.\n\nI got the Crystal Gold as it matches the gold of my iPhone, which makes a very attractive pairing.\n\nAlso includes in a silly little lanyard that can clip on the case which is very nice for a child, but is not appropriate for an adult male, and coming in only pink is definitely not my style. It would have been nice if it matched the color of the case.\n\nIf I could give this 4.75 stars I would, however, I must rate it 4 stars. With all the positives, the one negative is that the pairing button is now blocked by the clear case and cannot be pressed without removing the case from the AirPod charging case. This is not a problem for someone only using the AirPod with only an Apple product, but since I use them for my iPhone, iPad and my Android based exercise bike, which doesn‚Äôt automatically pair, then this is a slight inconvenience.\n\nAlso, with the added protection of the case, this case may not work with fixed connection docking/charging station. By this I mean where the lightening/USB-C connector is a fixed height above the docking base, so the user needs to be aware of this possibility. I have one docking station where this Case + AirPod case will no longer fit onto the extruded male lightening connector to make a connection. However, with another charging station that is fully magnetic charging, then it works just fine. You should also not have a problem directly connecting the cable into the AirPod case.",
