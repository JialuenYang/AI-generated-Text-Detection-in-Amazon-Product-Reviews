Since I started using it, it has revolutionized the way I work and connect.\nThe first thing that blew me away was its stunning 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display. The images are so sharp and the colors so vibrant that every viewing is an experience in itself. Whether watching movies, editing photos or simply browsing the web, the quality of the screen makes every activity more enjoyable.\nAt the heart of the iPad is the A14 Bionic chip, which delivers exceptional speed and performance. The efficiency of this chip is evident in everything I do, from effortless multitasking to the smooth operation of demanding apps and games. It's an incredibly powerful work tool that handles all my computing needs with ease.\nThe Wi-Fi 6 connectivity is another outstanding feature, providing a fast and reliable internet connection. This is essential for my workflow and entertainment, ensuring I am always connected with the best possible speed.\nThe 12MP cameras, both front and rear, are surprisingly good for a device in its class. Video conferencing is clearer and the photos I take are of great quality, making it a versatile tool for communication and content creation.\nThe Security and convenience are guaranteed with Touch ID. It's fast, reliable and adds a hassle-free layer of protection. And, of course, the battery life is phenomenal. I can go all day using it without worrying about recharging it, which is a huge relief in my busy daily life.\nLastly, the blue color design is simply beautiful. It's sleek, modern and stands out among other devices, adding a touch of personal style to my iPad experience.\nIn summary, the 10th generation Apple iPad is an exceptional device that combines power, beauty and versatility. It's more than a tablet; it's a daily companion that enriches every aspect of my digital life.",

			"body": "This is the real deal. This tablet is truly amazing. Last week, I had a Fire tablet, but I had to return it. The quality of this tablet is astounding – from its responsiveness and touch sensitivity to its storage capacity, everything is exceptional. Apple holds the number one spot for good reason. The performance, sleek design, and battery life are just the beginning; there's so much more to appreciate.",

			"body": "Received the iPad quickly and was easy to setup. It is replacing an 11 year old iPad dinosaur. And, the price was very good. The display is awesome and touch screen very responsive. 64 GB is plenty for my needs. It has both Touch ID and login pass code. The Touch ID works better than I expected. No facial recognition. Interesting that, to me, the volume bottoms are kind of reversed with the reduce volume on top and increase volume on the bottom. I've set up my news apps on the iPad for my morning coffee break. Much easier display than peering at the news on my iPhone 14. Glad I upgraded.",

			"body": "I am an Apple fan and this is just another great product. I like everything about it and it meets all of my expectations. I got the blue one for something different and I also like the color. The only thing I don't really understand is how Apple is mixing and matching the different generations of pencils with the different iPad types. Seems like with the Gen 1, Gen 2 and USB they want to be sure that it isn't easy to switch iPads. But I guess that is part of the marketing plan.",

			"title": "Nice update with one bad engineering choice",
			"body": "My previous iPad was air-2 which I had for 8 years and besides severely shortned battery life and slow browser on heavy pages it was still going strong. So with that retrospective I bought rather cheap basic model. Speed, picture, camera and microphone (I do a lot of video chat) is excellent, battery life is acceptable, noticeably better speakers (comparing to old air 2). 4 points because of one bad decision apple engineers made - power button is fingerprint id. Which works about half the time from first press, half the time from second press and so on. Just plain bad design (smaller area of scanner, button collects dirt). Another thing I thing they wrong is not providing wireless charging, but that’s somewhat expected of nowadays apple…",

So scooped up the deal while I could. Thing is fast, slim, and battery lasts SO LONG. Speakers are loud and sound is full. Screen isn’t fused to the digitizer like the Air model. But I can’t really tell! So don’t let that deter you from this model!",

			"body": "I bought the 10.9 inch Apple iPad because the 10.2 inch $249 iPad used the lightning connector. I already have a lot of USB-C stuff so my main reason for picking this device was to limit the number of connectors I had to keep track of.\n\nI chose yellow because it was the cheapest option (about $399 at the time I purchased it) but the metallic finish makes it appear more like gold to me. I am neither a color nor a precious metals expert, but if you told me the color of this iPad was supposed to be gold I would believe it (and I love it).\n\nVery pleased with the overnight shipping option. I ordered it fairly late last night and it arrived before noon the next morning.\n\nOrdered a $17 case that will be arriving tomorrow. This is my first brand-new tablet that I have ever owned (not including stuff like Kindles and other cheapy tablets I've tried that I all promptly returned because either their performance was not a good fit, it did not meet my needs or was riddled with involuntary ads). Previously I went with a used Samsung tablet back in 2015 that lasted for maybe 2 years before it became a brick and stopped turning on. I spent an hour on the phone with Samsung asking where to ship it to get it fixed. Samsung was not willing to repair it at all even though I was willing to pay for the repairs. I will never purchase another Samsung anything after that experience- they don't stand behind their own products.\n\nI've only owned this thing for a few minutes but I'm quite satisfied with it. I thought this package would include the Apple pencil, but alas, it did not.",
