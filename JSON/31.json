			"body": "I've been using the Tryone Gooseneck Tablet Holder Stand, primarily with my Amazon Kindle, and I'm quite pleased with its performance. The holder is definitely more suited for viewing or reading, which works perfectly for my Kindle. I haven't experienced any significant shaking while using the device, possibly because I use a wireless remote, which minimizes the need to touch or tap the tablet frequently.\n\nOne of the helpful features of this holder is its flexibility. Looping the gooseneck into an \"S\" shape or circle does provide additional stability, especially when using heavier tablets. The gooseneck itself is stiff and requires two hands for adjustment, as suggested by the manufacturer, but this stiffness contributes to its overall stability.\n\nThe reinforced bolt clamp base is sturdy and has been able to fit securely on my bed frame without any issues. I haven't encountered any problems with the base clamp being overly tight or at risk of breaking, which is reassuring.\n\nThe flexible arm, made of Aluminium-Magnesium Alloy, is both sturdy and flexible, as described. The 30-inch overall length is more than sufficient for my needs, offering great versatility in positioning the tablet.\n\nCompatibility is another strong point of this tablet holder. It fits a range of device sizes, and I've been using it with an 8-inch Kindle without any issues.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with the Tryone Gooseneck Tablet Holder Stand. It's a high-quality, versatile accessory that has enhanced my reading and viewing experience, particularly in bed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable tablet holder, especially for devices like Kindles and other similarly sized tablets.",
