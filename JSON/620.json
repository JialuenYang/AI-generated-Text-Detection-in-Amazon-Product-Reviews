			"body": "I recently purchased the gootu Mavic Air 2 and Mavic Air 2S charger, hoping for a reliable charging solution for my DJI drone batteries. However, I was extremely disappointed with the product. Firstly, the build quality feels cheap and flimsy, making me question its durability. Secondly, despite claiming to support up to PD 100W bidirectional fast charge, the charging speed was painfully slow, taking much longer than expected to charge my drone batteries. Additionally, the charger didnâ€™t seem to fit the batteries securely, leading to intermittent connections and unreliable charging. Overall, I would not recommend this charger as it failed to deliver on its promises and left me dissatisfied with its performance.",
