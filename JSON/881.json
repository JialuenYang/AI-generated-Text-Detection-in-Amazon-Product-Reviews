			"body": "We decided to try the MAM Night Pacifiers for our newborn, primarily attracted by the adorable whale design on them. However, it's safe to say that these pacifiers didn't quite hit the mark for us.\n\nOne of the puzzling aspects of our experience was that our newborn rarely used these pacifiers. It's challenging to pinpoint exactly what didn't resonate with him, but it's possible that the texture didn't match the comfort of mommy's nipple. Babies can be quite particular, and what works for one may not work for another, so what didn't work for us might indeed work for someone else.\n\nOn the positive side, we did appreciate the texture of the pacifier itself. It felt durable and well-made, which gave us some peace of mind. In fact, we accidentally dropped it a couple of times, and it emerged unscathed without any dents or damage. So, in terms of durability, these pacifiers seem to hold up quite well.\n\nIn conclusion, these pacifiers with their cute whale design left us with mixed feelings. While our newborn didn't take to them, it's worth noting that babies' preferences can vary widely. The texture of the pacifiers is a plus, and their durability is commendable. If you're in the market for pacifiers, it might be worth giving these a try, as what didn't work for us could very well work for you and your little one.",
