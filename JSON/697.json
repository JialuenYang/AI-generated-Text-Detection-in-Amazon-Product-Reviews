			"body": "I recently had the opportunity to try out the Dove Body Wash with Pump Deep Moisture for Dry Skin, and I have to say, I am extremely impressed with this product.\n\nFirst and foremost, the packaging is very convenient and practical. The pump makes it easy to dispense just the right amount of product, without any mess or wastage. The 30.6 oz size is also a great value for the price, and ensures that I won't be running out of this body wash anytime soon.\n\nAs someone with dry skin, I am always on the lookout for products that will help nourish and moisturize my skin. This body wash definitely does the job! The 24hr Renewing MicroMoisture formula leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated, even hours after showering. I have even noticed a significant improvement in the dry patches on my elbows and knees since using this body wash.\n\nThe scent of this body wash is also a major selling point for me. It has a light and refreshing fragrance that is not overpowering, yet still leaves a pleasant scent on my skin. It's perfect for someone who prefers a more subtle scent in their skincare products.\n\nAnother great thing about this body wash is that it is suitable for all skin types. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with irritation or harsh reactions. It is also gentle enough for daily use and does not strip the skin of its natural oils.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Dove Body Wash with Pump Deep Moisture for Dry Skin to anyone looking for a moisturizing body wash that delivers on its promises. It has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine and I can't imagine going back to any other body wash. Thank you Dove for creating such a fantastic product!",

As you age your skin looses its oil’s, and make your skin dryer than in your youth! Using a ph balanced soaps, makes all the difference in having youthful looking skin!\n\nBy using moisturizer you slowdown aging & help your skin from loosing it’s elasticity! Plus it helps aid you, from getting fine line wrinkles! We’re all die hard fans of Olay products, but just not in the shower anymore! Our grandmother fell in the bathtub and broke her hip at 68, she was never the same! She lived to be 94, but had to be monitored by health nurse. She walked with a limp, and ended up in a wheelchair for life!\n🚫🫧🛀🏻🧼🛁🫧🚿🚫\n\nAt the age of 40 I switched out all of my hand soap pumps, to Oil of Olay body wash! I used it in every bathroom & even in the laundry room & my kitchen! Because using regular hand soaps, started to dry out the skin on my hands! I seen the noticeable differences, on my skin right away! I still use a moisturizing bath soaps, as my hand soap!\n\nMy grandmother had used Ivory, for generations!\nShe educated us on the importance of only using PH balanced soap’s on our skin for both bodies & hair! You can purchase PH test strips at most drug store! Including Amazon!\n\nSo Ivory was what my mom & the family used!\nMy grandmother told me that all Ivory dish soaps & bar soaps are PH balanced! That Ivory soap is gentle enough to use on a baby, and even on your hair! So If you should run out of shampoo! Worst case scenario, she said Johnson’s Baby Shampoo is another PH balanced soap! She advised us to keep some on hand, at all times as a backup plan for your householdl!\n\nMy sister Vicki lives in Las Vegas, she has a swimming pool in back of her house. She used Olay body wash, and had some by her outside shower. The whole pool area was cement, except the shower area it was done in a beautiful ceramic tile.\n\nShe was having a pool party, with some work friends over. She decided to buy some Olay body wash in a large pump for her outside shower! Along with some Shampoo & Conditioner. So her guest would feel comfortable, as the evening progresses!\n\nShe said three people slipped, and almost fell! So I said well, that was a law suit waiting to happen! So she changed to her Dove body wash, she had been using dove for years! As her personal facial soap, and bath soap. Vicki said she loved how creamy it was on her skin! That it’s the best soap in the market place! No offense to grandma of course❣️\n\nWe all collectively switched to Dove! DOVE DEEP MOISTURE, NOURISHING BODY WASH.\n\nJust a heads up!\nHi I’m Kathi I live in Hawaii, my sister Vicki lives in Las Vegas, Patti lives in Iowa and Penni lives in Texas!\n\nI use to use Olay body wash, until I almost fell in my shower! It is literally a health hazard! It has way too much oil in it, do your heavy moisturizing after you get out of the shower! It coated my whole bathtub, knobs, and the wall tiles with oil! It caused an oily build up over everything!\n\nUsing the spray on scrubbing bubbles, wasn’t cutting it anymore! I had to take Ajax & a scouring pad to remove it! Way too much back breaking work, at age 70 I only want convenience in my daily life! Olay bath wash just wasn’t cutting it for me!\n\nLike I said I had a very hard time scrubbing it off! It just became to much, to deal with loved the Olay moisturizing bath wash. But hated the mess it made & how slippery it made my bathtub!\n\nI put one foot down & slid completely to the opposite side of the tub! I grabbed the wall to steady myself, and it was just as greasy! I thought for sure I was going down! My worst fears of ending up like my grandma! But thanks to a handicapped shower seat I have. I landed on it, but it scared the Bah-Jesus out of me!\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I switched to Dove for it’s moisturizing soap & safety reasons, I’m sharing my experience with moisturizing bath & shower!\n\nWe love Olay products and use them all the time, but their bath wash has so much oil in it. We each had problems with slipping in the shower, it builds up in the bath tub! It scared us to the point of changing our brands, to using only Dove Body Wash! We were all pleasantly surprised, it moisturized our skin just as good as Olay bath wash! But even better, none of us has slipped do to oily build up DOVE WE LOVE YOU!\nIt’s our families #1 choice of bath & shower soaps! We even use it for our hand soaps too❣️\nCouldn’t be happier with Doves products, so it will be passed down to our families future generations❣️🫧🛁🫧🛀🏻🧼🚿🫧\n\nFond memories, grandma would put all four of us little sisters. Into the bathtub together when we were young, she’d squirt Ivory dish soap in the tub & swish the soap around! Because we wanted a bubble bath, and bubble bath is what we got!\nShe was right about the PH balanced soaps’ ahead of her time she was! Because we grew up in the 1950’s❣️\n\nTrue test of a good soap is a ph balance strip! Find out what’s in your soaps & hair products!\n95% of the Shampoos & Conditioners sold in American stores, isn’t PH Balanced‼️🚫🧼🫧\n\nMahalo for your time!\nWe all feel safe using dove in the bathtub🫧 🛀🏻🧼& 🛀🏻🚿🫧and the shower❣️✅👌🏻👍🏻🤙🏻🫶🏻🤗💞\nMAHALO DOVE PRODUCTS!❌⭕️♥️⭕️❌🇺🇸🫶🏻",

It doesn't strip the oil on my skin and leaves it feeling nice and smooth. At first, I thought I wasn't doing a good enough job washing it off, but that wasn't the case. I was just use to soap stripping my skin of oils and leaving it kind of squeaky when running my hand over it. Now I need to figure out what I'm going to do with all the bars of soap remaining from the subscription I had :)",

			"body": "I love that this body wash lasts very long in my household, however, I do not like that it leaves my skin (just as with most body washes) feeling as if there is still another layer of soap on my body. To combat this feel, I have to either 1.) Put my shower head on blast, or 2.) Use my washcloth (soap rinsed off) to wipe the extra soap off my body as I rinse off. I always end up in changing the wayer pressure to remove the extra soap layer. On the plus side, you don't have to use much soap for it to lather up and spread.",
