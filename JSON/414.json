			"body": "I ordered this to put into a custom gaming simpit / desk and since WASD is starting to wear down on my primary keyboard, this seemed like a good idea. I had looked at several options, and having had good experiences with Redragon before, opted for the K585. The packaging is simple and includes the keyboard, the magnetic rest, a braided and reasonably long USB cable, and simple instructions. It was pretty much plug and play. I downloaded the K585 software from Redragon's site, and while it works, it does not size properly and the text in the app is cut off on my monitor. The keyboard has built in presets for lighting options, which I actually prefer and they work perfectly.\n\nAs has been stated in other reviews, the OUTEMU blue switches are clicky but feel good. The spacing and look of the keys is great. They are responsive when pressed. I've heard mixed reviews on the space bar. I love it. My thumb naturally lands on it and it feels perfectly placed to me, with no wobble on mine. While minimal, I also like the wrist rest. As others have said, it is plastic with a texture but no padding. The height is perfect, the magnets are solid, and despite being not padded, it is comfortable. I hooked the keyboard up and tested in a couple of games (Helldivers and Star Citizen) and there was no adjustment period for me, I was able to just start using it effectively. If you are on the fence about one-handed keyboards or are wearing out WASD, give this a try, especially for the low cost. I am happy that I did.",

			"title": "punches above its weight",
			"body": "The Redragon K585 DITI is an entry level mechanical keyboard that punches above its weight. That doesn't make it perfect for everyone, however.\n\nLook, it's pretty clear just by looking at this keyboard that it isn't a full keyboard. That intrinsically limits its target audience. For someone with ample desk space, this might not make the most sense as a purchase. But, on the flip side of that, for those with LESS space than usual, this can accomplish a very crucial goal of getting you back some of that valuable desk real-estate for your mouse, or other peripherals.\n\nFor instance, in my case, I needed more room for gaming. One of the problems I kept running into with my existing setup was that during an intense firefight, I would sometimes slap my mouse on the side of my keyboard, resulting in, almost always, poor results. And after trying for many months to get used to playing with my full-sized keyboard tilted at a 45 degree angle, it just became worth the $35 dollars or so to get rid of the hand-pain that induced and solve the mouse conundrum in a combo meal.\n\nOn the other hand, I could also see this being fairly useful for something like Asesprite, GIMP, or other design-oriented programs and tools. While I'm sure that there are people that could easily use the full spread of a full-sized keyboard with macros and still need more room, I'm not one of them, and I think it's fair to say that someone reading a review about this keyboard for that reason probably isn't either.\n\nSo, what sets this keyboard apart from the competition? The biggest thing for me has been the remappable buttons. With 5 dedicated macro-keys and two other keys that you have the *option* to remap (tilde and T), you've got 7 total keys to customize. There are severe limitations to this that can ultimately hamper that usability, but we'll come back to that later.\n\nIf you're someone that's into RGB, the keyboard lets you choose from 5 arrangements of color patterns that can range from what you'd expect from a typical RGB rainbow-vomit experience, to more subdued patterns that only appear when a key is pressed. To Redragons credit, the depth and color coverage is absolutely outstanding. It absolutely cannot be understated, in comparison to my Corsair RGB keyboard, the colors are just better on the K585.\n\nThere's even some hidden gems as far as features go, too. While you can change the color mode using the four dedicated mode-buttons atop the keyboard, this *also* serves as a convenient and quick way to swap between different macro bindings on those 7 macro keys. But, if someone were to decide that they wanted to change the color mode but not lose their bindings, they could just as easily use the function key and space key to cycle between the modes of their own volition.\n\nAdditionally, the keyboard has a detachable Type-C cable, so in the off chance that your cable got ruined, you would no longer be in the market for a whole keyboard, but just a cable. It also features an extra USB slot on the back that you could use for presumably anything a normal USB Type 2 slot could be used for, like a full keyboard if you needed that extra range, a wireless headset adapter, or just a convenient place to charge your phone.\n\nSo now we've covered the good, but what about the bad? Are there any \"gotchas\" to this product? That's a question with some complicated answers that mostly come down to your use case. For me, one of the biggest issues with the device was the limitations behind the macro recording. As you can only record buttons that are available on the device itself, it makes rebinding almost mandatory for some games. In Destiny 2, as an example, I have my social tab bound to my O key normally, but as the K585 doesn’t have an O key, it makes opening that menu kind of a chore. My options at that point were to either change which keyboard I was pressing keys on for only specific keys, or just rebind these actions. Luckily, Destiny 2 has two binding settings for each action, so I was able to set most of these crucial actions to be the F1 through F4 keys as their fallback binding, in the off chance that I wanted to use a full-sized keyboard for any reason.\n\n*But*, even this has consequences. If you’re playing a game that doesn’t have multiple binding options, or rebinding at all, you’re just going to be out of luck. On top of that, if you’re someone that uses the alt-key for whatever reason, you could potentially run into issues with either accidentally or unintentionally using ALT+F4 to close your game or program of choice. Ideally, passing a keyboard through the K585 would allow it to register these macros as any press, like how a lot of keyboard or mouse macro software works already. Of course, the K585 doesn’t have any software to speak of, so it may just be a limitation of the hardware they use to power these macro keys.\n\nAnother binding issue that I’ve run into is the problem of *un*-binding keys. While you *can* unbind them, it appears to only have a group unbind option. For my use case, I’ve somehow managed to lose the T binding entirely. If I change modes it’s fine, or if I were to reset *the entire binding setup* I could fix it, but I can’t just rebind my T key to T, as it.. Isn’t T anymore. I also can’t just reset *that particular* binding, but this is again, probably a limitation of whatever they use to power the macros.\n\nThankfully, that covers the largest of my gripes with the keyboard. I’m no mechanical keyboard expert by any means, but it uses blue switches that feel very good to me. If you’re not sure what kind of switches you like, the mechanical keyboards subreddit seems to always recommend buying a switch tester. They run around 17 dollars on Amazon, however, so if you’re looking for a budget option in something like this keyboard, you’ll potentially just be paying for peace of mind. With that said, the switches are audible, but they don’t drive me up the walls by any means.\n\nMy only other real complaint with this is probably that the F key doesn’t have the nice tactile bump that I’m accustomed to on my full-sized keyboard. That lead to quite a few times where my senses and muscle memory clashed with each other and ultimately caused me to fumble around aimlessly, but that had an easy enough fix. For me, I just put a dab of super glue on the key to give it a little bump, and that’s been more than enough to ease the aforementioned clashing.\n\nI will say that when I was browsing Amazon to figure out what exactly I was going to buy, it took me a while to get over the absolutely dreadful looking font that is printed on the keys. To me, it came off as a very edgy and try-hard font, but in person it didn’t really bother me all that much. And, thankfully, most of the time I spend with this keyboard, I’m looking at the screen and not the keyboard, so truthfully it doesn’t bother me anymore.\n\nSo, is the K585 worth it? In my opinion, absolutely! If you’re looking for a keyboard of this style, there are a ton of positive things to say here. If you like RGB, it’s got it, if you don’t, you can turn it off. If you’re worried about price, it’s inexpensive (especially in comparison to the competition), and if you’re working with limited desk space, this is a natural pick.",

			"body": "Love the keys. Love the brown switches. Love the keycaps even. They feel nice. Yes, it's edgy space font but it's not TOO bad. About a 2/10 on the HR Giger scale. Only one problem:\n\nWASD is dumb. Very very dumb. Why? I don't care that it's what the entire world uses. If you learn how to touch type, your left hand will naturally fall on the home key, F. That's why it has a little nub on it. So you can develop feel memory and just know your fingers are on the home keys. So why wouldn't you use ESDF instead? Then you get a pinky key too. A. WASD is stupid. Sorry.\n\nAnyhow, they put the first completely smooth F key on anything I've ever seen in my life. I had to throw it away. I had a few spares. It looks awesome with a proper F key that's a different color. I use F a lot. : ) So it's important that it's correct. Now I can find my movement keys by feel again. I don't have to waste time looking.\n\nSuperglue, that's up to you. This is a personal preference. I put a little dab on the wrist rest to make it permanent. I loved it so much. I just put it on the magnets and let them be together forever. It's better that way.\n\nOtherwise, wow what a nice addition to a Star Citizen setup. This sits nicely off to the left of a VKB Omni-Throttle for quick accessible on-foot controls, or anything else. Opening up the mobiglass quick because you have a real F1 key. Etc. tapping escape to fix a keybind quick. Setting up a macro for Flight > ATC > VTOL. Makes the game that much better. Worth every penny.\n\nIt gets a five for value. They are using good quality parts. They did put thought into the design. Like you can tell it was designed for your fingers to fall on F key home position based on where the space is placed. You literally have to stretch to hit it if you use wasd. ESDF? your hand just falls naturally on everything. So nice. The switches feel great. Love that soft bump in the press. You subconsciously start remembering where that bump happens and it improves your timing because it coincides with actuation. That's the benefit of browns for gaming. You aren't just mashing the key into the board for timing. You don't have to. So your keyboard takes less abuse. And you maintain a lower level of chill, so game better.\n\nVery comfortable. Perfect wrist rest. Perfect key position. Great key caps. Great lighting, Oh great lighting options. They offer five. For me it was like, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, OH!. The fifth one I liked a lot. It's a blue and green burst gradient. Very awesome looking. Matches my stuff.\n\nThe only other thing to maybe complain about is it slides around a little. Like the bottom isn't grippy enough. Easily fixed with two pieces of VHB tape on the bottom but worth mentioning.\n\nI am one very happy customer.",

			"body": "This is an excellent gaming keypad. It has a large amount keys and an ergonomic design that is well suited for any gaming configuration. It comes with extra switches, a key remover and USB-C cable. The included magnetic wrist guard is a nice feature.\n\nAfter my MERC Stealth keypad finally died I needed a replacement after 15 years of muscle memory with that keypad design. Most keypads on the market either do not have sufficient number of keys or do not have an ergonomic enough design to compete with my previous keypad. The Redgragon K585 fits the bill, but it will require a few modifications to do so.\n\nTo emulate the Merc Stealth keypad you will need to download the Reddragon K585RGB keyboard app from the Reddragon website. Once the keys are programed, the key assignments are stored on the keyboard and can be moved from PC to PC without using the app. Second, you will need a USB keyboard to plug into the Reddragon keypad to program the new keys. Third, you will need to remove the old keys with the included key remover and replace them with new keys (Redgragon and others sell replacement keys on Amazon and are inexpensive). Finally, using the app and the keyboard, you can program the Reddragon keyboard with your new key bindings. All of the keys are programmable except the \"rec\" key. The F1-F4 are replaceable and programmable as well as the key to the right of the F4 key. The G1-5 keys can be used as macros or single key bindings (they just cannot be replaced). You can also change or turn off the background RGB colors.\n\nThis is the second K585 keyboard I have purchased and is a very well priced replacement for the keypad side of the Merc Stealth keyboard.",

			"title": "Good Hardware - funky software",
			"body": "Yet another misleading product. They claim you have 42 keys to program but there are some limitations. In other products claiming programmability that I own you are allowed to specify key combinations such as CTRL-SHIFT-C for any programmable key and only need to resort to \"Macros\" if you really want to issue a series of sequential key strokes like \"CTRL-A followed by SHIFT-C followed by CTRL H\" or \"LEFT Arrow - LEFT Arrow - DOWN Arrow\" but to the guys who designed this keypad a macro is any thing involving more than a single key - in other words if you want to have a key emit a capital H by pressing SHIFT H then that, to these guys, is a \"Macro.\" So in order to substitute a different key for any key on the keyboard you first have to define a macro for the key sequence. While that is not rocket science it is tedious involving defining a \"macro\" by selecting macro mode, naming the macro, recording the key strokes, stopping the recording, and then applying the macro to the key. I recently bought a Penclic N3 keypad and every single key on that keypad could be programmed for any key combination from a simple one stroke like an 'a' or a \"CTRL-SHIFT-F3\" and also to program multiple keystroke \"macros\" for any key. Recording single keys consisted of selecting the key in their software and it put up a keyboard picture and you selected which keys you wanted to have that key emulate, like selecting \"CTRL\", \"Shift\", and \"F3\" on the keyboard picture which were then highlighted and clicking OK to record them. That capability makes this Redragon K585 look like a joke in comparison. The Redragon documentation on their website and here on Amazon claim only 7 keys can have macros applied, which are the 5 \"G\" keys plus a couple of others which are associated to the four different modes (M1 thru M4 on the top row) giving you 28 total alleged macros. Yet I was able to define macros for regular keys, not just the special G1-5 keys. So I'm not sure what they're talking about saying the Macros are limited to the G keys. Maybe it's that they only store 28 Macros - or they mean something different - that they'll take a single key macro sequence for any key but a multiple keystroke sequence can only be done on the G keys. In any case the documentation is worse than minimalist - the manual that comes with in the box is two pages, repeated several times in multiple languages.\nThis keypad comes with no software in the box but is recognized in Windows 10 automatically as a \"USB Device\" with the attributes and icon of a keyboard. Which I suppose is fine if you're going to use it as a typical Left Hand action/shooter/RPG game KB, but if you want to program it you need software. And when you download the software from Redragon's website you get a package of 3 files, a PDF which tells you to run the included \"Update_Firmware.exe\" before you run the \"Redragon K585RGB Keyboard-updated.exe\" install program. The PDF file you get in the software package doesn't go into any real detail other than showing you what the update process looks like and what the customization software looks like. You get what you pay for and this is typical of the lower priced Chinese products.\nThe Update program was really wonky, presenting a panel with a screwed up background of random black panels against a white background and two prominent buttons \"start update\" and \"device message\" - clicking on device message filled in data in 3 boxes giving you some kind of version data. Clicking start update caused it to take a few seconds to do some kind of firmware update and two progress messages appeared in a white panel below the buttons. After doing that, following the instructions in the PDF, I was able to run the main software which, for some reason needs to put up a white square in the upper left corner of my screen blocking out some of the desktop icons I use frequently and then putting up a panel in the center of my display with a picture of the keypad and giving you the ability to set the RGB light patterns and to program the keys for the functions you need.\nThe keypad feels solid enough with good key action. And other than the convoluted \"macro\" programming and the strange update program this keypad will probably fit my needs. After I've used it for a few weeks I'll report on whether it was worth the time and trouble!!!",

I stumbled across the K585 when I was looking for something that was similar but more affordable, I've had it for over 3 years now and really like it. It's really good for a lot of different games where most of the core functions/controls of the game are on the left side of the keyboard, and it saves you space. The arm rest is detachable for those who prefer not to use it and it even has a USB port that you can use to plug another peripheral into it (I use the port for the K530 Pro that I bought recently.)\nIf you don't really care about big name peripheral brands such as Razer or Logitech and want something that's more bang for buck, then this item is definitely for you.

			"title": "Versatile with some nice DIY features",
			"body": "TLDR: Likely the best sub $50 One Handed Keyboard you'll find; decent wrist rest and good thumb button placement, nice weight and non-sliding feet, nearly entirely reprogrammable and hot swappable (see below), and for those who like to void warranties, easily disassembled. It could use a slightly stronger angle, sound dampening (the thin plastic base is pingy) and more robust software, but for the price, you can't really see those as faults.\n\nI own more OHKs than I'd like to admit, but I dislike the spacebar on a standard keyboard while gaming (don't like my thumb curled under my palm). This one isn't comparable to the likes of Razer, but for half the price and more buttons, with some DIY, you'll have yourself the best all-around gaming keyboard for under $100.\n\nSETUP/USAGE: Works straight out of the box on most anything. The usb-passthrough is a true hub, so it works with almost any (USB 2.0) device, just don't expect it to charge anything. Great for connecting a mouse when using with a laptop lacking ports or Playstation/Xbox (only tried it with a PS4, works as expected). If you have Windows 10, the software allows you to reprogram all but the profile (M1-M4), Function, and recorder buttons. The software is basic but functional. I didn't have troubles with the included braided cable or any other USB-C cable I had. Connection was firm. The base doesn't slide around, but does have a largish footprint. It has more buttons than high end OHKs; too many for straight FPS, but useful for FP/TP RPGs, Mobas, 4X, or any game that needs 'G' or 'T'. The stock switches are decent, if a bit wobbly, the keycaps are thin ABS, but not terrible.\n\nERGONOMICS: I like the placement of the two thumb buttons, but they might be an issue for small hands. The standard staggered keys should make switching from a standard keyboard easy, even if I prefer ortholinear keys. The wristrest is hard but not uncomfortable, and while some may like padding, I find hard surfaces less irritating and sweaty. The additional Map (M) and N and P keys are nicely placed so that nearly anything you need to do can be done with one hand.\n\nSOFTWARE: the software is basic and not exactly self explanatory, but isn't hard to work once you figure it out. It only works on Windows 10, and it doesn't allow extended options (you can program any of the main keys to any key on a standard keyboard, media function, mouse action, or a macro; it has profiles (4) but not layers). The changes are saved to the board, so they'll travel with it. You can't do much with the lighting other than change speed, direction, and color of the built-in effects. Still, it's more versatile than the software (or lack of it) found on other low-cost OHKs.\n\nMATERIALS/CONSTRUCTION: The main body is, what I assume is, a single piece of ABS. The bottom is the same, as is the wristrest. The top plate is a non-ferrous metal, the switches are plate mounted (3-pin). The stabilizers are part of the body, so not replaceable and made of the same plastic. The keycaps could be better, but expected at this price. Together, it feels solid, and a good balance of weight for stability and portability (other than the size).\n\nDIY: beyond the software, most of the keys are also \"hot swappable\" (the exception being the G2-G5 keys, which seem to be soldered in). The sockets are *not* Kailh, which makes it harder to get the keyswitch in straight, and it has a rather tall LED; you'll need a switch that had a cutout for SMDs (I swapped mine for Akko Blue Oceans because they're available on Amazon and fit just fine). The stabilizers are built in to the plate, so aren't replaceable and are pretty cheap. Lubing helped a bit. Deconstruction means removing the bottom screws (two are under the rubber feet, but as long as your careful, they stick back on just fine),, and then a set of screws to remove the plate/pcb from the base. No foam or gasket, but, again for the price, this isn't surprising. Removing the plate from the PCB means removing all the keyswitches, but with 4 soldered into the sockets this is close to impossible, and then popping some pressure clips. I don't recommend. Since the top and sides are all one piece, I found it easy to paint (in the picture, it's a matte white spray with masked stripes and a clear coat finish). The keycaps are replaceable, but the non-standard \"T\" and \"G\" can make finding a set difficult. It worked with several cables I tried from various manufacturers.\n\nOverall, this is a great little piece of gaming tech. While not high-end, the ease of use, good button count, and versatility through software and hardware modifications, make this a great choice for an inspiring gamer/builder looking for something to play on and also tinker with, without breaking the bank.",

I had a habit of hitting p instead of spacebar.\n\nI'm not incredibly fond of the map being top right as it seems to take more to get to the button than it did \"before\" when using the laptop keyboard. I'm still uncertain about it.\n\nHonest, other than the map key being maybe near the space bar and thumb accessible, i think the only additional thing I could have asked for is a \"home row bump\" on the F key.

			"body": "I love gaming with this keyboard. Love it so much that I bought two. One for travel and one for my main work/gaming station. Everything is great until I wanted to start changing out switches.\n\nIf you want to mod and change out switches for anything outside of Redragon's switches then you have to go with the White version with their brown switch. This is the only one I can confirm that will take 3 & 5 pole switches. Note, any decent updated switch you buy today is going to be 5 pole. I switched out the Redragon browns for MD Cream linear switches and it was a night and day difference. I replaced every switch and it was closer to the journey of getting the \"thock\" I love that I have with my NEO65 and Monsgeek keyboard.\n\nWhen it came to installing the same switches on the Black one with Redragon's Blue switches, I was shocked to only see 3 holes. Now this makes no sense to me for the same functionality keyboard as the white but in black but using a different PCB. I understand they most likely updated the PCB on the white but they should do the same for the Black.\n\nSo if you want to mod this keyboard you are stuck with white and what I can confirm is the White with Brown switches that have 5 pole support. If you want a Black one of these to mod for any decent switch you are left with either painting the white or chopping off the 2 additional poles on the 5-pole switch (not really recommended).\n\nFor this reason, this is why I only gave it a 4 star rating but for the money, it's a great gaming keypad.",

			"body": "In short the Red Dragon K585 is a great, and probably one of the best single handed gaming keyboards out there. With that being said it is not without its flaws.\n\nThe build is alright. It's using ABS plastic which is smooth/slightly textured. It will show scratches and dents easily with bezels being gloss. The wrist wrest is also slightly granulated for your palm to grip. It gets the job done. The inside of the keyboard has a steel plate to really make sure you can beat on those keys in the heat of the moment without having to worry that it's going to damage anything. The MX Cherry blue switches are wonderful. They are what you'd expect from a $150 keyboard. No membranes here. True mechanical glory. The key caps on the other hand are a little too smooth for my taste. It also has a \"Gamer\" font on the keys which has made me double check I'm actually pressing the B key until you are one with the layout of the keypad. The M key is nestled away in the top right corner with a globe icon key cap. The macro keys (G1-G5) have the same smooth texture as the keys. They all have one point of contact on a blue switch which at times can make the G1 key feel very loose or wobbly. The space bar is off to the side where your thumb would naturally rest. Which makes using the space bar at first uncomfortable but you become accustomed. The M1-REC keys are a hard plastic but have a very responsive and have tactile click. The LEDs are gorgeous and are once again comparable to a high end keyboard. They are bright and vibrant. The software has gotten a lot of hate. EVERY key is programmable except the profile keys. In the software you make macros then apply them to the key under the profile you want. The software is not user friendly but gets the job done. It is worth noting that in the software you can program macro keys for multimedia (Play/Pause,Next,Prev) and mouse keys but no Mouse 3,4,etc. As well each key can not be a independent color. You may only use a few modes in the color of choice, Rainbow, or black for no color. Once the software has closed the profiles save to the device itself. So no need to keep the software on your computer if your neat and tidy. The pad uses USB 2.0 with a detachable USB C connector which comes with a braided USB C cable that is not loose by any means. Kinda had the jam the thing in their each time. It has a USB port/passthrough on the back. Tested using a USB Hardrive the speed loss was nothing of concern, my Corsair Ironclaw had the same polling rate and latency. Perfect for flashdrives, mice, or a microphone. All in all it's a wonderful keypad for those looking for MOBA,FPS,MMO, even a Photoshop/premier macro pad. The box also comes with a key puller, replaceable blue switches, and a Red Dragon sticker to show of your pride.\n\nThe Pros\nTrue Mechanical Cherry MX Blue\n1000hz Polling rate\nCompact\nUSB C Detachable\nUSB Passthrough\nBeautiful Vibrant RGB\nMacro everything/Mouse Macros/Multimedia Macros\nMagnets holding wrist rest are STRONG\n\nThe Cons (My opinion)\nWobbles on flat surface\nSpace Bar is horrific\nMacro keys are loose\nKeycaps/Macro keys have horrible texture\nI hate the texture of the pad\nI hate the wrist pad texture\nI hate the smooth texture of everything\nG1 is in a stupid location for use\nI hate that stupid globe key\nG Keys don't light evenly\nAlt is too far left When you remove the wrist rest it looks ugly because exposed magnets/Wish was slimmer\nNo flip out feet for a incline\nmy profile keys were broken\n\nTo explain some of my personal cons. Out of the box the M1 key was broken. The switch was stuck which was annoying but I don't switch profiles often. So not a big concern. The profile buttons are raised into a bevel which the bevel sat too low on mine causing the M1 profile unusable unless sanded or loosening. Decided to not sand or keep loose and just give up on M1. Simply a defect of the mold. The space bar uses 3 points to hold it in place making it secure. The macro keys despite being the same size do not so they are wobbly and loose. I hate smooth cheap textures. I prefer matt satin or stippled. I hate the red of the red dragon logo. I replaced the keys I use with HUYUN Cherry MX Key Switchs which helped. Other then my minor OCD complaints and the defective profile key it's pretty great. Just not for me.",

The switches can be confusing, but Redragon's actual website explains them all in detail, more than it is here on Amazon. I'd reference that if you were looking for more information!

			"body": "Redragon K585 DITI is my first one handed gaming keyboard, and I am really satisfied with this product. I am single - player gamer who doesn't play MMOs at all and I wondered do I really need this at all for my gaming since I know that one handed keyboards are primarily used for games which require a lot of key inputs. My first entrance into the world of mechanical keyboards was with with a mecha - membrane full size Logitech G213 Prodigy which I really quite liked both it's integrated palm rest and full size were too much for me, the after it finally went kaput I bought a Royal Kludge RK61 Wired 60% Mechanical keyboard with Brown switches and I was blown away by the typing and gaming experience on this puppy. As I was gaming I found myself setting the keyboard on the far left size for comfort and returning it to the middle to type when ever I was not gaming. Then when I saw this Redragon product, the thing that caught my eye was that this is one of the first one handed keyboard that has most of the keys for gamin that I need (most one handed keyboard are simply additional G keys who don't have regular keys imprinted on them, both this product has both). When I first played Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Player Unknowns Battlegrounds I was simply amazed how ergonomic can help you a lot and make your experience comfortable with every key simply that close. One of the things that they forgot to add which I see as a big problem is the key for I (which is used for inventory, PUGB included) and J (journal, mostly single - player games) which I use regularly during gaming, while I got to say that moving M key to the top was the best idea that they could come up with. All of these problems are simply solved by downloading the software and programing keys that you don't use that much (every key can be programmed in software and profiles can be switched on the fly so you just have to pass the learning curve). I bought this with reds which are perfect for gaming and I got to say that the experience is a lot smother with them, the build quality is good so you need not worry about it (USB A passthrough is nice addition for your wired or wireless mouse). One of the things that I found that could be improved is for the F keys to be mapped on number with the FN key and they be switched for I and J on top so that they could be used that way, I simply don't use the F keys at all. If you are skeptical about this product don't be, your left hand is going to thank you in the long run, and your gaming experience is going to go to next level! I got to ask the question, why haven't e - sports player used this marvel which is built for them in the first place, come on people let's get a wider audience in the one handed space!",

			"title": "Odd Design choices, But good quality for the price (Now with brown switches! :D)",
			"body": "Quick Review:\nWhat I liked:\n-Brown switches\n-Real RGB (with patterns)\n-Fairly quiet.\n-Full Key Remapping\n-Stores profiles on device\n-Removable (type-c) cable\n-Removable wrist rest.\n\nDislikes:\n-No indicators for what profile you're on.\n-RGB colors are tied to profiles\n-wrist rest too low\n-Hard to reach macro keys\n-Pretty much the same price as a full sized budget mechanical keyboard\n\n--Switches---\nI opted for the new 'brown switches' version,\nI kinda wish they required a bit more force, but they still feel good, without being very loud.\n(The feel MUCH better than the keys on 'mechanical feel' keyboards.\n\n--Comfort/Feel--\nI was upgrading from a ~2013 razer nostromo, I really loved that thing, but hated the software, also the razer had gotten kinda old, and the button labels were wearing off.\n\nThe first difference I noticed with the red dragon was how much larger and heaver it was.\n\nSince I have large hands, I figured that would be a plus, but I found this fairly uncomfortable, even with the palm rest.\nI could game for hours with the razer, but the rest on this is not angled enough, so withing 15 mins, I was already getting hand cramps.\n\nusing something to elevate my palm even more seemed to help a bit, so I may just pick up a mouse palm rest or something.\n\nOther than that, the buttons feel nice, and they're spaced well, however the macro buttons and escape are fairly hard to hit.\n\n--Design--\n\nLooks great, individually backlit keys, real RGB, Outemu Brown Switches,\n\nHowever none of the keys have a any finger bumps, so it's very easy to line up your fingers in the wrong spot.\nAlso, while this keyboard 'does' offer full RGB, it only offers a few presets.\nAnd if you set up any macros/ profiles, they will be tied to your color choice.\n\nSo (as crazy as it sounds) you if you set G1 as escape on 'pulsing colors' it will not work when your backlight is set to static.\nEach macro profile can only use a single lighting/color option.\n\n---Macros/Rebinding/Software--\nSaying the software is barebones would be a HUGE understatement.\nThere's no 'help' Section, and no tool tips, you just fumble around until you find everything.\n\nBut once you learn how to work it, it offers quite a few options.\nYou can record macros, change lighting and polling rate(125hz-1,000hz), and by double clicking, you can rebind any key! (including all letters, and Capslock) they can even be bound to mouse actions and media keys.\n\nAnd unlike with razer synapse, you can actually save all 4 profiles to the actual device!\nSo you can use your macros and custom keybinds on PCs and console!\n\nYou can even set up macros on the go, using the record button.\n\n--Conclusion--\nA really nice budget option, But again you need to ask yourself, why by this over a full sized or 10Key-less keyboard.\nIt's about the same price as Red Dragon's other options, but seems to offer less keys.\n\nI'd say this is mainly for people who either need to save desktop space, or who want something that offers a higher level of customization, and that comes out the box with brown switches.",

Despite the description, I found no marking on the product itself, which was a nice surprise.\n\nThe controller arrived with an instruction manual, several replacement red switches, two key/switch pullers, and a USB cord. I don't actually know if this is all of the original contents, but it's everything I needed.\n\nWhen I plugged the controller in, I quickly discovered that the \"a\" key did not work 9/10 times it was pushed. I pulled the key cap and switch with the provided tools and replaced the switch which resolved the issue, as all the other keys seem to be working 100%.\n\nI'm am old school gamer and had a similar controller years ago (the Razor Tartarus, but before Razor made them and put lights on them), and this one compares well. It's not as ergonomic as the Razor, but this model has more keys, has macro keys, and the keys themselves feel a lot nicer. It is missing the 4-way thumb directional pad from the Tartarus, which I liked having, but overall I like this one better.\n\nThis controller is well worth the $40 asking price, I'm just a cheapskate. I think I got a great deal and am happy with the purchase. I would definitely do it again!",

			"body": "I play some fps and absolutely hate when I hit my full-sized Corsair keyboard during an intense moment when I needed that bit more of turn, you know? So I decided to invest in a gaming pad. Looked at a lot. My friend has a Tartarus V2 and I just don't really like the shape of it and the joystick. Too different. I wanted something more traditional and this is half the price too. I got the red silent switches, they're quiet to my liking. I replaced the WASD keys with my Corsair textured ones. I also cut and glued some of a mouse pad I had to the wrist rest, as I actually really like using it, (I hate the little thin things they give with keyboards for wrist support) but it is just plastic and my hands tend to sweat some, so it was a little gross and hot lol. This was a simple and easy upgrade for me and this thing is pretty much perfect now. Maybe the cord could be a couple feet longer, just in case. It's not short, but doesn't reach directly to my mobo in my set up. I have my Corsair keyboard plugged into 2 USB 3.0 ports since it's got a USB plug on it, and plugging this keypad into my keyboard works just fine. This keypad also has an extra USB slot on it, though it's only 2.0 I believe. I generally only use these keyboard USB ports to charge various little things anyway. Software is simple, just Google it, go to their site, pick the k585 and download/install. It's pretty straight forward to use. As far as size, it feels like a normal keyboard, I picture my hand in WASD position and on 1234 position like I use in Diablo 2. Feels great. The space bar is in a great position, but the little void between the keys and space bar took me a little getting used to, not long at all. I'll update if anything changes but I think this thing will last for years of regular gaming. Feels solid, and it's price can't be beat for what it does. I wish the red switches were the same price but a few more bucks for silence is worth it to me. I don't know why so many people love that super loud click lol",

Since box was open I pulled out the plastic mold that holds the keyboard and woala, the G3 key was off, the piece was all over the place, I have to put it back in place, keyboard had some finger prints, not surprising me at all, and the plastic mold that holds the keyboard and accessories have scratches all over as if someone scratched that thing against the wall or the floor.\n\nAs just for the keyboard itself, as I said the G3 key was off, keyboard had finger prints, but was looking clean over all, not dust or scratches or mayor damage at all, so far.\n\nAs soon as a put that G3 key back in place I started pressing all keys to get the feel of it and make sure no keys were off or any malfunction or weird noise. so far keys were feeling fine, no noises or weird stuff.\n\nCable to connect keyboard to pc was looking good so I clean the keyboard and give rid of those finger prints and gave it a shot and proceeded to connect it to my pc.\n\nI just got the product today, and I been testing it.

Connected the cable and started working right away, Rgb and configurations working just fine, all buttoms feels smooth and solid, not lose or broken or noisy at all when pressing, no hard to push key, the response of pushing keys with the reaction in game is sharp.

There was not a whole lot of info on the web about it and just a couple of video reviews to go over the features and functionality of the keyboard, but for the price (about $30 USD) I decided to give it a go, and I am very glad I did.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n- The switches are very clicky and responsive.\n- The removable wrist rest is magnetic but even so is fairly strong, no worries that while using the keyboards you will snap it off.\n- The RGB lights are surprisingly bright\n- The base if fairly strong and has some heft, such that the keyboard is definitely not dancing around the surface of my desk.\n- It has a USB C connector to connect to the PC and a spare USB type A (rectangular) on the base for peripherals. The keyboard has an internal USB hub so that spare connector is NOT a passthru which helps not take an extra USB port on your PC.\n- The software (which you download from Redragon's website) is very intuitive, super simple and gets the job done. The macro recording function has a fairly decent span of options. Contrary to other reviews I have seen, you CAN in fact use a full sized keyboard to record your macros and the Redragon will effectively use those keys in the macro. I have for example a screenshot function that requires pressing Windows + Alt + G set to G5, the Redragon does not have a windows button and yet the macro works without any hitches.\n\nSome potential lowlights:\n\n- The blue switches are fairly noisy even when compared to equivalent Cherry Blue switches. Not an issue for me as I play with headphones and my mic is very good at killing ambient noise but you may want to take that into account.\n- There are only 5 RGB modes: breathing, rainbow, wave, spiral, trace; each has its own funky name and only 2 allow you to select you own color. However there is no \"leave RGB lights ON Solid color\" option. I use breathing set to slowest speed to give an impression of permanent solid color and it's a good compromise.\n- The keyboard footprint is big. My hands are definitely not small (about 8in/20cm from wrist to finger tip), so while I can reach the space button relatively comfortably and the G keys on the left, someone with smaller hands may need to travel further and get you off from WASD home\n- Speaking of WASD, those keys are not marked in any special way (and F key does not have the subtle tactile bump) to help you find \"home\"\n\nOverall, the net balance is that for only 30 bucks or so you get a pretty solid half keyboard with a robust set of options for PC gaming. Highly recommend. If this thing would work with PS4/Xbox (which I have not tried) then it would be an absolute must buy!",

(FN+Space (Thumb, also convenient));\n- And if you're like me and don't like destroying the build-in keyboard on your laptop or main keyboard by gaming, then you'll likely want to use something that will take the brunt of the force.\n- It's nice for laptop use if you have the room because you can angle it at the side and have both arms in a similar position instead of 1 arm in front and the other on the side (mouse).\n\nThat's a good summary IMO. I'll try to get back for more feedback if needed.\nI wish there was a quieter version and also a second half of the keyboard for people that might like to have a keyboard that can be positioned however you like that can be programmed completely and have multiple profiles available. Perhaps profile import and export as well. (I'm sure there's a way to go into the files and find it, copy and restore it at will🤷‍♂️)",

			"body": "It's been a little over 2 years to the day since I purchased this keyboard and it has withstood countless hours of heavy use playing Fortnite, and it works as well now as the day I first plugged it in. But in the last couple of months, I found myself questioning the need for tactile (clicky) switches and started looking into what it would take to change the blue switches the keyboard came with and replaced them with linear ones. The answer is... EASY! But first you need to navigate through some of the road blocks I encountered during the process. First things first. You need to remove the 7 screws on the bottom panel (these screws join the bottom and top halves together), 5 of them are easy enough to locate, the other two are hidden behind the foot pads on the left and right side of the keyboard (when viewing from above). I personally did not want to peel off the footpads so I opted to break through the foot pads and unscrewed them. Yes it will leave a small hole but that only affects its form not its function. Remove all the keycaps to reveal the 4 screws that hold the pcb board to the bottom panel.\nAfter separating the top and bottom halves from each other, you need to remove the 2 screws holding the M keys and Rec key to remove the PCB board. Yes, this is a hot swappable board, but very different from what the market usually offers. Pulling out these switches with a switch puller is not recommended, it took heaven and earth to pull them apart and I broke a few of the locking prongs in using this method. Instead I would find a punch a little smaller than the center column and push them out from the other side. This method worked the best for me. Make sure the switches that you buy have the little notch for the SMD LED's, they will not sit properly into the PCB if you don't and last but not least, for some reason Redragon chose to solder in the G2 to G5 keys so you would need to unsolder these switches if you choose to replace them as well. Coincidentally, you can see the difference between a soldered pin versus a hot swappable pin by looking at the solder domes, the dome for the soldered pin has a flatter profile while the hot swappable is pointier. That's all folks hope this provided some insight for everybody.",

Certain games (In particular skyrim, fallout 3/4, new vegas, 76 - all on same engine) when your running forward (W key) the A and/or D keys fail to respond in some situations. For the longest time I assumed it was an issue with the game engine, but when testing with other games it happens there as well (I only recently tested in gta online because I often use my old 104 keyboard for that due to the need for a num-keypad. It happens there as well, and in far cry 4 and 5.) What I believe is the problem is it is not true ps/2 connection and has to simulate a proper n-key which works when your not activily pressing/releasing/holding/ multiple keys in random combos. (After a few it just seems to disable the A,S,D keys until you release the W key along with all other keys in that left side)\n\nThe keys all feel very solid (very little key wobble, IE-side to side) and the tactile feedback is excellent.\n\nThe Lighting is meh.. its either solid on or 'breathing' effect (or off) and u cannot dim/adjust the level at all. Very minor issue with everything else you get. Could have also used a USB pass though (Again, minor issue)\n\nFor the price its a 5 star deal easily. Even if it was 2x the price it would be a good deal.\n\n(Will add/edit review once I used keyboard for a few months)\n\nRevised: After 2 months I have found it is NOT n-key anymore (I do not know what changed, but its not true n-key rollover at this time)\n\nThe A key in particular is superseeded by any other key except Q and Z (As in if your holding the A key, no other key except Q or Z will register) - but if your using any other key THEN press A, it will register. Disappointed because at first it was a great board to use, but something within has changed (its not software related, and the keys DO still all work, just that its no longer a true N-key rollover board anymore = See above more recent 'review' a paragraph above.)",

All in all, I wanted to give myself more mouse space when I'm playing games. Cutting your keyboard in half is a great way to do just that!\n\nThe quality of the keyboard itself is okay. It's plastic which for the price is what you should expect, however the keyboard feels a bit hollow and the keycaps are very thin. Let me preface this by saying I'm a bit of a keyboard snob. I've custom built a few and now I need more from my keyboards!\n\nThe gaming quality of it is nice though. Definitely gives you more room for your mouse. The thumb buttons take some getting used to, but it's still pretty solid! Keep your regular keyboard close by though, it's annoying to not be able to chat or if you forget that there's a weird keybind your half keyboard doesn't have.\n\nAfter mods:\nSo I like to build keyboards. I took this one apart to fill it with foam, changed out the switches for akko jelly black that I lubed myself. I lubed and band-aid modded the stabilizers and tried it again. (If you don't know what any of that meant, don't worry about it) after all the mods, I can say it does sound better. Still a bit hollow, but I think better keycaps would help a lot with how it feels. The downside is that the keycaps are not at all a standard size as you can see with the T and G keys. You can definitely find keycaps that work for it, but that's just putting a LOT of money into a cheap (relatively) keyboard that you should probably save.\n\nFun and functional overall, just feels a little bit cheap.",

I have 2 and have used both daily for more than 2 years. Both are going strong. I occasionally have key drops, but that is likely more a function of docking/redocking than the keyboard. The software did what I needed it to. I only customized a few things, and the customization was stored onboard so it can be used w/a work computer w/o the software. I wish the build and keycaps were on par with the K556 (metal chassis and keycaps just have a nicer feel), but this is really a phenomenal one-handed keyboard for the price. I've had no issues w/the switches. It's been great for my purposes.\n\nIf you are looking at this to make a test or temp split keyboard setup or to maintain a full keyboard w/a split option, this has been amazing. The angle is slightly different from the K556, but it's not enough to be problematic. I do wish the F had a homing nub on it, but I swapped the F keys between this and the K556 to get the bump. That swap has kept this my setup for more than 2 years now. And the combined cost of the K585 and K556 is a pretty inexpensive split setup. It does eat a lot of desk space though. Some people have gotten lemons, it happens. I've had 2 of each model under daily usage for 2+y and all 4 keyboards are still going strong.",

			"title": "The spacebar placement is weird, but otherwise a good keyboard",
			"body": "I use this primarily for gaming and 3D modeling. Luckily, most games will allow you to remap the space bar to a more natural key (either the N or P on this keyboard; this is the position a traditional spacebar would be.) The space bar on this keyboard was designed for someone with really large hands. It feels unnatural for small to average hands to reach.\n\nIf you download the software for this keyboard from Redragon's website, you can rebind any keys to important ones that are missing on small keyboards, such as the Enter key, or backspace. I keep a full size keyboard nearby on a laptop stand to use for actual typing. But for gaming or modeling, this small keyboard works really well; it's light and compact. And like I said, using the software I was able to map some of the extra G keys to useful missing ones. Having the extra keys on this model is really handy. Also in the place of the F5 key, there's a key with a globe icon that operates an M key; which is commonly the map in a lot of games. I thought that was kind of a cool thing. But again, if you want F5 to be there still, you can always change it with the software.\n\nI picked this model mostly because it's the only one I found that wasn't blue switches or membrane. The brown switches are definitely not silent, but they're not incredibly loud and they're easy to push (unlike membrane.)\n\nOverall, this keyboard is worth getting for those who want something more compact. My mouse hand wanted to be tighter in/positioned in front of my chest, but a full-size keyboard was preventing that. Switching to this smaller keyboard has alleviated the discomfort and strain I was getting in my right shoulder from my mouse hand being forced into a bad angle. Now my mouse is positioned where the arrow keys/numpad is on a standard keyboard.\n\nGlad I got this keyboard! I had chronic issues with my right shoulder being literally stuck at a weird angle from using a mouse so much in a bad position. Now my right shoulder blade is healing, and lies mostly flat like the left.\n\nI took a star off due to the spacebar primarily, but also because the wrist rest is just hard plastic. I wish it were a bit more comfortable. My old keyboard had a padded wrist rest and I miss that. But all in all, I paid $40 for this keyboard and it was worth it for me.\n\nUPDATE 8/3/20: I began having issues with the \"A\" key in July. It doesn't always accept input and is really noticeable when gaming. I replaced the switch with one of the spares in the box, but the problem persisted, so I believe there is a defect in the board. I contacted Redragon's customer service with my invoice and they emailed back the next day saying they will send me out a new keyboard. So hopefully they follow through, but they have responsive customer service, which is always a plus!\nUPDATE: I received the new keyboard quickly, and it functions well. Fingers crossed it stays that way!\n\nUPDATE 1/18/21: Well, the issue with the intermittently unresponsive A key has hit the new board too. I'm going to keep using this one for now but I'm in the market for a better replacement. Ah well. Taking my review down a star. Maybe Redragon will update the design on this to fix the A key issue.",

The buttons are a bit on the big side which is perfect for my application since I need to be able to finds things off of feel quickly and the massive G keys really highlight this feature. I was also pleased to see that the 15ft USB C cable I purchased did not impact functionality. This would not have been possible if the cable was hard mounted to the keyboard and would have caused me to have to use a hub in order for the keyboard to reach the USB ports on the computer.\n\nPROS:\n- Fully programmable with the exception of the Function key\n- Large, easy to find buttons\n- Bright backlight but mediocre functionality (more on this in CONS)\n- Killer price\n- Great ergonomics\n\nCONS:\n- The macro programming software could be a little better. It works but the interface is pretty archaic and makes programming a large number of keys a tedious effort. It's also very easy to accidentally overwrite existing macros if you don't pay close attention to what you're doing.\n- Backlight options are very limited. While it offers some pretty cool effects it does NOT offer any sort of \"Always On\" option that stays one color. I don't need to have a light show going off in my line of sight while I'm focusing on not punting people off the track. (please no punterino Jimmer) Aside from that, the settings for one option bleed over into other options (i.e. color choices set on one option are retained when switching to other options).\n- The USB cable is kind of short. This one is more of a personal gripe since it doesn't really impact most normal desktop setups. However it is still shorter than the cable on any of my other gaming peripherals including a Redragon M901 mouse. Thankfully this issue is easily resolved by replacing the USB cable with a longer one and I had no issues using an aftermarket 15ft USB C cable.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with it but I'm taking a star off for the limited backlight functionality and the clunky macro software. If Redragon were to offer an \"Always On\" option for the backlight this would be 5 stars from me all day long.",

			"title": "Poor Ergonomics, not comfortable to use",
			"body": "In short, I hate this keypad and am sorry I purchased it. The makers don’t seem to have even a basic understanding of ergonomics. This keypad is for gaming, not for typing words, and it’s set up poorly for that. The keys do feel nice. The removeable wrist rest is a nice design. It has nice backlighting. But key layout seems like the most important part of a gaming pad, and this one misses the mark by a lot.\n\nThe “home position” for gaming is with the index finger on the D (right), middle finger on S (back) and ring finger on A (left.) When in that position:\n\nFirst, the index finger should have a raised ridge so you know your finders are in the right spot. This is typically on the “F” key. I’d have been happy with it on any key, but it doesn’t have that at all. So if you have to move your hand way up to the top to hit a key, you have to look at the keypad to get your fingers back in the right spot. That can kill you in a game.\n\nSecond, the rest of the keys should be lined up so that W is directly above S and X is directly below S. Instead of straightening the keys for gaming like some gaming pads do, they’ve actually done a greater offset than my regular keyboard. The keys just don’t line up well. That offset is a carryover from mechanical keyboards, intended to actually slow down the typist. Not necessary or desirable on a one sided gaming pad. This problem is compounded by how they’ve set the space bar and wrist rest. If you place your hand “naturally” on the wrist rest, with the thumb laying comfortably on the space key, not only do your fingers naturally rest off by one key (for gaming), but the natural movements of your fingers are off by 45 degrees. If you have arthritis, which I do, it makes this basically impossible to use. If you line your fingers up so that your middle finger is aligned with W, S, and X, then your wrist comes off the pad and your thumb ends up clear up at G1. It’s just poorly laid out.\n\nThird, they’ve included some keys from the “right” side of the keyboard, which seems nice, except that they’ve made some odd choices. The “M” key for “map” in many games isn’t labeled M. It has some icon on it and it’s clear up with the function keys. I think it’s supposed to be a globe, but it’s non obvious. They also included N and P, but did it right next to eachother, below the line with X. They put the P key right where ALT is on most standard keyboards. That’s caused me a lot of problems. Also, I’ve never used the P or N key in any game I’ve played, so not sure why they chose those two, but no “I” for inventory or “J” for Journal.\n\nLastly, kind of by it’s design this will have to sit to the left of my keyboard, and the included cable won’t reach my PC under my desk. It’s too short. I’ll give them props for making it a removeable cable, so I could buy a longer cable, but should I have to?",

If I could have another hardware change in addition to a reset button, it'd be a small set of buttons with all numbers 0 to 9.\n\nThe software isn't great either. Editing existing macros could be easier, and it would really help if the window could be resized to see more of the macro at a time. It gets the job done, it's just more tedious than it has to be. The window also minimizes whenever the keypad is disconnected, which has to be done whenever a long macro needs to be stopped. That's annoying when creating and editing long macros since the keypad has to be disconnected or switched off many times. The program doesn't exit, which is good, and the window should stay open as well. Fixing those two things would make macro creation & editing far less annoying. If I could have one more software change, it'd be a master setting to slow down macros, which would help with finding errors in new macros.\n\nAside from those, this works pretty well. It does a lot for its price. I think the changes above would make it perfect, and I'd definitely buy that revised keypad.",

Lethal's at TAB, Tactical at R, F use, etc. So my learning curve on this gaming keyboard was helped by that by just mapping everything in the same way. After playing on the N52 with the claw hand position due to the curved/raised wrist rest, I was a bit of an adjustment in hand placement. Didn't feel natural for about 4-5 days (maybe 10 hours in).\n\nSince then, It's becoming to require less thought and everything is becoming a reaction now without thought. The only part that's still odd is reaching for all the extra buttons that you can program having 41 vs. 20. I still have about 9 that I haven't programed. 1st world problems.\n\nThe rest is comfortable and even though significantly different than what I've been used to for a long time, has become a positive.

I had so much of a blast using it with my FPS' and even World of Warcraft (because coupled with a multi-button mouse, why not, right?) that I use it rather regularly. A huge plus for me was that you can pretty much program any key to a key you would find on a full keyboard if you grab their downloadable tool and you can have multiple layout profiles. Some nice added bonuses were the fact the cable is actually separate, an added USB slot in the keyboard itself, and that it comes with some replacement switches and tools which I thought was really nice.\n\nI grabbed myself the Brown switches since I'm not a fan of the ultra 'clickiness' of the popular blue switches but this would be personal preference.\n\nMy only 'gripe' is that the hand rest is a little too hard/harsh for my hand and wrist but this is from someone with bony baby hands so even a desk with a nice padded large mousepad still hurts after a while. Plus, it's detachable so you can take my 4 stars in the Ergonomic area with a grain of salt- I would have put 4.5 if I could have. Otherwise the keyboard feels great and has a nice sturdy feel to it in my opinion (especially compared to a cheaper half keyboard I had bought before and ended up returning)\n\nI did hit one small snag with one of my buttons having issues of randomly activating or sticking (making for rather amusing moments in Warcraft of my toon running in circles) but with a little back and fourth and troubleshooting with their very responsive customer service, they were more than happy to send me a replacement once we both deemed the problem couldn't be fixed.

Additionally, the G13 setup/design isn't just a replication of the left side of a keyboard, it was specifically designed for what an optimal layout would be for a dedicated, mappable gaming keypad. No one else has created a design that good. (7 keys across the two top rows is especially beneficial). The two mouse click buttons and thumbstick in the bottom right are also something superior no-one else has done. Its software was also the best of anything released with the ability to create tons of unique profiles on a give PC, as well as 5 portable ones in member you can use on any PC.\n\nI mention the above as to why I didn't give this 5 stars. Basically, an evolved G13 with more keys and mechanical switches would be a 5/5, but no one has pulled that off yet. Given all that however, I think this is more worthwhile than more expensive $80-110 options. They don't have enough keys and are encroaching on a price range for a full mechanical keyboard that would support assignable keys/profiles and macro recording.",

That's the only reason I knocked it down a star. Its nice to see the keys at night but i would like to have the ability to do it with just a consistent solid color of my choice.\n\nupdate-- 3 years later, still using, like it alot, want another one so here buying another one, wireless this time with brown switches",

The switches are smooth and have a nice clicky break to them, that is already driving my wife crazy when I play FPS games. I don't mind the noise, because I wear a headset, but I can understand how that might be a deal-breaker for someone. RedDragon also sells this model with \"Cherry\" switches in them, that, I assume, are different in some way, but I have not felt them. Mine has \"Blue\" switches. They are not MX switches, they are a Chinese off-brand, but they feel good regardless. It also includes a switch removal tool, as well as 4 extra replacement switches. The wrist-support clips on magnetically, and feels pretty good, but it is made out of a hard plastic that might get uncomfortable after a while. This does not matter to me, because I don't use it; this is a personal preference, that has nothing to do with this keyboard - I've just never been comfortable using a wrist support. As with other RedDragon products, the included instruction manual is basically hot garbage, but there are some tutorials on YouTube that can quickly teach you how to use the RedDragon software, which is pretty decent. It will not link with Razer Chroma, but the RGB is still addressable through the proprietary software. With regard to all of these thoughts, I believe that this is the best half-keyboard I have ever used, especially for the price.\n\nEDIT: After about a year of use, the USB-C port on the back of the keyboard that connects the keyboard to the computer started to crap out on me. I was able to keep it going for another year after that. In March of 2023, it stopped working entirely. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but I would require some micro-solder work to replace the USB-C port, and I do not have the tools for that. It was fun while it lasted, which was about 2 years. Take from that what you will",

I have really gotten used to typing papers leaning back off my desk with a wireless, slim style keyboard. I would also connect to a projector to watch movies. However I would never game like this ever. I always game competitively with mechanical switch keyboards but I typically (like 99%) of the one only use half of it. Having this half keyboard allows me to have my gaming keyboard, typing keyboard, and gaming mouse in perfect reach. It’s stable with the rubber supports on the bottom. I slay with this thing.\n\nThese are the things it could improve on:\n\n1. Pad the inclined wrist rest (even just slightly). I’m definitely going to get a soft tape or something to paste on top cuz that about all it needs. It at r perfect angle but in tense gaming sessions it can feel alittle hard.\n\n2. The c-connect yo the keyboard is super sensitive. If my desk were not a thick, immovable mess the slightest bump could disconnect the keyboard’s commands to the cpu. Easy fix but it’s really really sensitive.\n\n3. Please please allow for different mechanical switch options. I can live with the blues, but giving the option will open up a lot of doors.\n\n4. Those extra “G” keys around keyboard and the weird space bar location is an interesting addition, but probably need to be changed. Space at being in a totally different spot needs a reason or placed back where is usually is because...well....it takes time to get used to ....if there isn’t a good reason for it being there...it shouldn’t be there. Any etra buttons like the Gs should go above or the the right if anything. My hand is usually in the way of seeing them where they are now.\n\n5. It really could be built alittle less cheap. I get that the price is pretty solid but it feel like really cheap plastic.\n\n6. This is picky but the possible addition of a a traditional keyboard prop up to incline the keyboard wouldn’t hurt either.\n\nOther than that, happy with it so far. If a better one comes out with reds I’m definitely buying it.\n\nJ",

By this, I really mean I had to make some modifications to it to make it work best for me:\n\nFor example, the device comes in two parts: the keyboard itself and the hand rest. The underside grips of the keyboard keep this part relatively secure and it doesn't slide nearly at all. However, the hand rest only has a single underside grip and then some little raised pieces of plastic. When the hand rest was attached this was causing the whole device to slide around and made it kind of frustrating to use. I got around this by ordering some cheap adhesive grip pads and sticking one to the bottom of the hand rest, now its much better and doesn't move at all while I'm pressing keys.\n\nThe other thing that was pretty annoying was the length of the USB-C cable. People have their PCs in different places plus I also have a standing desk and the cord was not long enough to handle my setup.

The included wrist wrest does a fine job of keeping my hand in a nice position and the spacebar placement is one of the biggest game changers in terms of comfort. Definitely better than using my normal keyboard at an angle.\n\nThe build quality is as expected, plastic but sturdy. The keycaps themselves feel fine and the larger ones such as spacebar and macro keys don't have much of a wobble to them.\n\nI haven't spent much time using the macro recording feature so I can't comment on it but the 5 G keys along the side and above the spacebar work well. They are bound to F1-F5 by default which works fine for me as I didn't usually use those keys in-game as it is.\n\nG5 and G4 are easily accessible with my pinkie as they are near the shift key, so I tend to bind those to items I need quick access to or hud options such as opening a map or viewing my inventory. G3 and G2 are harder to reach but convenient enough to use as a mute toggle or similar interaction for comms or other programs running outside of the game itself. G1 requires some maneuvering but is convenient enough for binding a macro or lesser-used game bindings as it is still much more accessible than using the right side of a keyboard.\n\nThe switches themselves feel adequate and match up to other blue style tactile switches I've used in the past. I tend to prefer linear switches but these do the job fine, though they are a bit loud. If you stream or plan to use this keyboard in situations where extra noise is an issue, go with the brown switch option.\n\nOverall this is a blast to use. The G keys combined with the extra keys already on my mouse give enough flexibility to stay in one position without reaching for out-of-the way keys elsewhere on my board.

The larger size of the K585, and the absolutely useless magnetic wrist rest are the biggest reasons for the loss of comfort. I found that putting a small bean bag under my wrist mitigates the discomfort, but I just can't stand how poorly it \"attaches\" to the controller. As for the size, those with smaller hands or shorter fingers might find reaching certain keys difficult, or a tendency to mush the zxc keys while using WASD. Then again, those of us cursed with drummer hands do that anyway with any keyboard.\nI've been a fan of Redragon products for many years.

It has a USB port in the back, along with the usb-c port that it uses to connect to your PC.\nThere is a lot of customization out of the box. You can re-program every key. You can create macros for keys.\nThe software is actually really easy to use. It does not come with software in the box, nor does it provide a software download link or qr code or anything. The software is available on Redragon's website. It was very easy for me to locate, installation went off without a hitch and the keypad was up and running in no time.\nThere are two things that it's missing though.\nIt does not have a static color option. There is always some type of 'special effect' on any of the options you choose. I'm not a fan of this at all.\nAlso, you cannot \"turn off\" a key. I hate the caps lock key for example. I don't want it on my gaming keypad. Other keyboard software can just disable keys so they don't do anything(or you can map that button to do something else).\nIf it weren't for those two missing features this would have been an absolute win for me.

Every key can be any color and they don't take advantage of that. Luckily with the open source program \"OpenRGB\" you can assign any color to any key and save it. Unfortunately the program doesn't tell you what keys are what (you have to set it up as a full size RedDragon keyboard) but I did the work for you. Just look at the picture. Also the second thing I wish they did was include media keys, especially volume up and down. Apart from that I just had to tape the wrist support in place but that personal preference.

Manual states top m buttons control led display, not really, m1,m2 did change but m3,m4 ng. Search on utube, led control is fn shift to change ! Almost sent back because I thought the m3, m4 broke. like the keyboard otherwise. The usa site on line does not even show this keyboard available, just the older model. Magnetic wrist holder could use more grip, strength to hold. Depending on how you brace it , can unlatch easy. I may place plastic board under to hold better.",

Some people have complained about it being loud, but it's really not that bad. I do wish the \"R\" button had some bumps or something to help with hand placement without looking, but a little dab of clear fingernail polish did the trick. Would buy again.",
