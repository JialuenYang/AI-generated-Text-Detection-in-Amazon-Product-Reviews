It's only $8 payments increments for this which I'll pay it off when I have the money. It's only 5 months six. Yeah five payments thought that was pretty cool. I think that's a prime benefit or something I don't know. Or it's to do with who your purchasing it through that accepts that and it's without application. It's just straight up. You make your five installments not too shabby now that I know that's on Amazon with the payments. Probably do that with a lot of purchases.

			"body": "Streaming device from Amazon. It arrived and initially I thought I had a dud. I had it plugged into a HDMI switcher box and there wasn't any video or audio. Plugged it into a different non-smart TV and it fired right up, so I brought it back to my main TV (also a non-smart tv) which is easily over 12 years old now and still doing what TVs do best (I leave you to determine what that is... *chuckles*). After plugging it directly into one of the four HDMI ports on the back, it worked as intended. Eventually, I pulled it from the TV and plugged it into a roughly 8 year old audio/video receiver for surround sound and it works absolutely fine in it too. Recently, I pulled the plug from satellite TV which was charging too much for programming in terms of my budget and I used my \"cost savings\" to purchase one of these Firesticks for a more diversified and less costly entertainment solution.\n\nI did learn this device has built-in Bluetooth support, which means you can sync it up with your smart phone or a gaming controller. I personally play quite a few retro games and was pleasantly surprised to discover it's possible to play them on this device by side-loading emulators on it, and that it can go up to roughly Sony PSP level gaming. NOT the heavier 3D games, mind you, but some of the lighter titles of the library work particularly well. Anything at Sony PlayStation 1 level and below that in generation will run flawlessly. Not a bad option to have sitting on the couch or in your favorite over-sized chair with nothing going on a desire to step away from the streaming stuff for a bit. *smiles happily*\n\nWould I recommend it? If you don't have one of these or another device like it, then yes. If you already have something similar or a first generation Firestick, then I'd say no. Pretty straightforward. In my personal case, I didn't have anything like it and now I do. And it performs satisfactorily, I will say in conclusion.",

I had to order a new one because I wanted the live features for a BTS concert on the new Weverse's app. It worked perfectly and I was able to get JK's last concert live streamed. On the side notes there are more advertisements so I'm concerned about the younger generations watching the ads. But it does help you keep your mind busy and choosing what show you want to watch next. Also has a live option and I can watch shows live which are often seem to be just repeated. You can have leverage show or Bob Ross show or antique shopping show. A murder station etc I even have a new Asian with love station. Lots of different Asian shows are showing on that.,.......... If you do not have an updated or smart TV this is the way to go. All you need is an HDMI port. ( Do you need the original remote control or the ability to change the HDMI ports on the side of the TV........This is free service if you buy the fire stick. (Yes, there is Netflix and Hulu and others that you can pay for. They also have Vicki Asian channel. So you can buy things and rent things. Make sure you read it before you click the okay button. My mom paid for a bone show for $5 and she now owns that one show in that one season. She did not even get the whole season. Which you can do I'm sure you just have to read all the fine lines. So if you have children in the house you may have to set up the children's safety feature. They are quick to answer your phone calls if you have a problem.

Even though all my TVs are \"smart\" TVs, it seems that when they are 2 to 3 years old they stop getting updates, so the Fire Stick is there to keep the apps rolling along when the TV manufacturer drops the ball. The reason I got the \"All-new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K streaming device\" now (November 2023) is that I found out that the 4K fire sticks can show you the video from your Wyze smart cameras. Full screen or as a Picture-in-picture in the top right corner of the screen (great for watching for approaching trick-or-treaters while watching a show). When I tried to show this to my wife on our main family room TV, it didn't work - because it has an original Fire TV Stick from 2017, which does not support that kind of viewing.\nSo - Black Friday comes and I get a latest model Fire Stick 4K to replace my 2017 model.\nOne thing I was disappointed with was it appeared that I could transfer all the apps and settings from the old stick over to the new one. This didn't happen. I ended up having to install all the apps myself, and re-login to all the apps. This took about 4 hours! However, when using the new Fire Stick it's performance was amazing! I had buffering issues with the old one and the new one streams flawlessly. Also, one of the 4 buttons on the stick is for DirecTV, which I have. I didn't realize there was a DirectTV app until I saw this button. I was aware of a DirecTV NOW! app, but that was for a different service. The (apparently new) DirectTV app allows you to watch your programs recorded on the DVR, plus all your DirectTV channels, plus On Demand. I have the main DVR and 2 Genies that I can already do this with using the DirectTV hardware, but now I can also watch DirecTV recordings, live tv, and on demand on the other 2 TVs.\nAnd (maybe - needs to be seen) do the same on the Travel Fire Stick while vacationing.

Mamasita, Oooooooo....\n\nIn summary, after a couple of years of watching commercials on a smart TV, I'm getting close to getting a paid service. Of course, you can subscribe to most any of them on the Fire Stick.\n\nI think you can get them on a computer, too. Pluto, Hulu, etc... You can run HDMI from your computer to the TV, and then you don't need a Fire Stick, or Ruko, or anything. A real computer would provide fastest reaction times, and offer things like recording, time shifting, watching one program while recording another so there'd be no chance of ever turning off the TV... You plug a TV card into the computer, and they come with remote controls...\n\nOn another tangent (thanks for tolerating), the least compressed, highest quality video is on digital broadcast TV. I should go into the TV-antenna installation business, if I weren't afraid of heights. But you should start with a rabbit ears antenna duct-taped to your window, and see if you get plenty of free stations that way. Or any stations at all.

I have a couple of freezes, jumps to blank screen, and one really odd thing where I selected play for an item and it displayed the previous option screen rather than the one I selected. It did that repeatedly until returned to the home screen and then selected my choice. old review follows - this was a gift from someone the purchase was a hardship. sad because it is this “expletive deleted” device is infuriating. the menu is cluttered with apps and services amazon wants you to buy and the responsiveness to commands is glacial. every command is a prayer that most certainly will not be answered. the system goes wherever it wants whenever it wants and i'm not sure where i am when i get there. when i try to move from one selection to the next, more often than not it takes me back to the opening screen. if you are a gambler this is the device for you. if you have a low tolerance for frustration then avoid this purchase.",

If you have this issue call the customer service and they will help you. What happened with me, is that the first fire stick tried to delivery to my home around 4am and they could not get through the gate. When I contacted customer service to inform them they can try to deliver again anytime after 6am, they basically cancelled my first delivery and sent a replacement.\n\nWhen the item arrived, I figured it was the replacement stick. It wasn't though, it was the one they cancelled. During set up, I had all kinds of problems. The next day, another stick arrived. So the one I was trying to set up was deactived because it was reported as lost. Which is why I could not get through the set up process. The 2nd one, I was able to get throug the set up process in less than 10 minutes. I orignally wrote a 1-star review and a representative called me to go over my concerns. I give them 5-stars for caring enough to make the call and their willingness to resolve any issues.\n\nWith that said, overall I say the customer service is amazing, quick to respond to any concerns, and the fire stick tv is a product I have been using for years. The only other thing I would recommend is to look into the warranties. Because my fire sticks do not seem to last more than 1 1/2 - 2 years.",

All of mine populated with their graphics, etc within a few hours of being installed. That wasn’t as fast as usual, but I can’t use them all at once either so I wasn’t too worried about it.\n\nI typically use this later at night in my bedroom on an LG TV that was my Mom’s. It’s a nice, larger TV that is not a smart TV and not connected to cable either so I really wasn’t sure how this would perform. It hasn’t let me down yet. And I’m very familiar with Amazon products. This is my 3rd Fire Stick and I also have a 42” Fire TV. It responds quickly, doesn’t lag during streaming (which is all I use it for) and I have only had to reboot it once.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this remote is that they didn’t add the light up in the dark option like they did when they upgraded the other stand alone version. What gives with that Amazon?? And I’m fairly certain this one costs more too (I think that remote is $39??). I understand this one is also a Fire Stick, but shouldn’t that mean is going to better?? More bang for your buck type thing. That’s my logic at least ;-)\n\nBoo is all I can say to that. And double boo for removing Hulu off the bottom and adding Direct TV/Peacock. And there’s no extra button to add your own. Yes, I can ask Alexa to do it. I just don’t want to. I’d rather have my button back…but I’ll deal.\n\n11/11/23 Updated: I’m adding this as it has begun to wear on my last nerve recently. I stream on my Fire TV ALL the time right now as I broke my ankle. A couple hours before I go to sleep I lay in bed continuing to watch whatever was on. Problem being is that when I go to launch the show from the “continue watching” it is NEVER in the right spot anymore! And I’m talking the completely wrong season even with plenty of time allowed for it to update itself once I’ve shut off my Fire TV. Paramount+ is the biggest culprit of this recently.\nAnd then you may not even find it in the programs listed. I use my subscription via Prime because the PP app is wonky and I’m not paying Paramount for a sketchy app. Soooo I then have to go to the search feature and look the damn thing up…UGH!! Really?!? Please run an update and make my 11-12pm more pleasant…PLEASE!!! Yes, I know this sounds petty and maybe even stupid to some, but it’s inconvenient and not what I paid for.
